It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.

It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00PWSAXAM	Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity	Only use twice a week	I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.

15	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B0019QITHK	Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black	Color Is Accurate	I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen.

I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.
18	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000HE8NK8	Barnett Diablo Slingshot	good enough	As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.

I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time.

It's like they didn't test it to see if it works.
26	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B0018KL0YG	Oregano Oil CERTIFIED ORGANIC- Joy of the Mountain - 75% Carvacrol (30mL) Brand: Joy of the Mountain	Did you know? Oregano delivers more antioxidants than blueberries, oranges or apples	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.

We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years.

It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer.

It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz	Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!
35	__label1__	3	N	Camera	B0049I48JI	Nikon Deluxe Digital SLR Camera Case - Gadget Bag	hard to accommodate	The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture.

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(

39	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B005HXTMYA	Protocol For Life Balance - Red Yeast Rice Plus 600 mg 90 vcaps	The best natural product to lower cholesterol	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!

41	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B000F5PM4E	Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets	My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

44	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B00028P640	Natural Factors Pycnogenol Pine Bark 25mg Capsules, 60-Count	The Gift of Life from Trees! Fountain of youth	My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />"So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.

They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.

114	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8JH9M	Pampers Cruisers Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus,160 Count	Good for mobility	We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.

119	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8LL9Q	Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Plus Pack Size 1, 276 Count	Good diaper on the right baby	There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.

I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me. I am walking proof that there is SOMETHING out there that works!

If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market.

156	__label1__	2	N	Sports	B000UEP0NI	FitDeck Bodyweight	Full and Complete Review of Fit Deck Bodyweight	I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.

I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out.

The look and feel of them is cool but there is definitely work to be done if these are to be sold for $100.<br /><br />After dealing with these I got myself a good headset that I absolutely love. The sound quality is great and I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over two months of use. I can wear them for hours on end with no issue!<br /><br />If you want a great headset, check out this pair here on Amazon -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qp9Fhd<br /><br />I hope I could help others out by sharing my experience with these headsets, you won't regret getting the pair I did!

Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.

I am still learning the art of getting these molds filled correctly, but am starting to have a bit more success. I used the ice for the first time this week and I was a little bit non-plussed by the length of time they lasted. I was using the ice inside, in a controlled-temperature environment and I can't say that I noticed they lasted any longer than say, a cube from an actual ice cube tray. However ... I still think they are worth it because the look much cooler than a cube! I am eager to try using filtered water to see if I can get crystal clear ice balls. The ball is about the size of a golf ball. I would like it to be a bit bigger (I am starting to giggle as I write this) so you could plop one in a rocks glass instead of two. However, this size also fits in tall, slim glasses. They're fun! If you're serving drinks or just enjoy a good sip of Scotch, you should have these.

Not noticeable from the outside, but when you sit on it, you can feel the nails and wooden frame underneath. Not really comfortable after say 10-15 minutes.

I was so sore that it was discouraging me from working out. I wanted to continue making great progress toward my goal but without the joint pain. I did some research and read several reviews about Glucosamine Chondroitin and MSM. I decided to try Kirkland brand and it worked pretty well. Pain subsided a bit but my joints were still achy, but a definite improvement. These tablets are also really big and difficult to swallow. I found another supplement called Flexadrene that contains Glucosamine, Chondriotin and MSM along with over 20 other ingredients that relieve joint pain [[ASIN:B00NOG20ZK Flexadrene – Complete Joint Care Formula]]I have been taking these for a month and my joint pain is all but gone and my workout regimen is even more intense. Plus, the Flexadrene pills are much easier to swallow. Overall, this is a good product, but if you don't mind spending a few extra dollars, I suggest trying Flexadrene.

282	__label1__	4	N	Books	006114844X	And Only to Deceive (Lady Emily)	Romantic, elegant mystery	The premise of And Only to Deceive excited me enough to get a copy the very same day I first heard about it. The idea of a reverse love story, a woman falling in love with the man she married only after his death, married with the mystery/suspense, as well as the Victorian setting appealed to me very much.<br /><br />Alexander portrayed the romantic part of the romantic suspense in an elegant and intelligent manner. Through reading his journals, Emily is astounded to discover that the ordinary aristocrat she thought she had married harbored passionate love for her and was far more interesting than she knew. This made me question Emily's intelligence and powers of observation, though. Was she so self-absorbed that she didn't take the time to get to know the man she was going to spend the rest of her life with? The more she finds out about Phillip, the more regret grows until Emily falls in love with her dead husband and begins to truly mourn him. Rather than letting her heroine lionize Philip, without question, Alexander then begins to poke holes in his character and Emily's idolatry of him. In keeping with Emily's newfound interest in Greek antiquities and Greek literature, there is a long-running discourse throughout the book regarding who is the better hero, Achilles or Hector. Alexander uses this discourse in subtle comparison to Emily's love for her dead husband - the man she never knew and built up in her mind as an incomparable demi-god (like Achilles) with her flawed (but alive) suitors (like Hector, a human who dares battle Achilles, protected by the gods, to protect his kingdom).<br /><br />I liked Alexander's exploration of Emily's liminal role in Victorian society as a widow, neither mother or wife or virgin bride-to-be. She comes to the realization that without a husband, yet with his fortune, she is basically a free woman, able to do as she pleases within or even out of society.<br /><br />Emily's character, however, made no emotional connection with me. Other than being very beautiful, so much so that her dead husband's secret nickname for her was Kallista (the most beautiful) and being an avid reader, she was not very interesting. I could not see why sophisticated Philip fell in love with her; however, Alexander shows that perhaps, like Emily falling in love with the dead Philip, Philip also fell in love with a figment of his own romantic imagination. He didn't know her, but chose her for her beauty, as Paris chose Helen for hers.<br /><br />Emily develops, however, throughout the course of the story. Initially inspired by her husband's interests, she develops interests of her own: Greek antiquities, learning ancient Greek, the epic poems. She also explores her newfound freedom as an independent woman of means.<br /><br />"Dissatisfied, I put down the book, irritated that Philip was not there. I desperately wanted the chance to argue about these things with him. As I sat there, I slowly began to realize that my own opinions were quite different from those of my husband. Until then I had attributed all my interest in classical antiquity to Phillip and had assumed that his own studies would serve as an adequate guide for mine. I no longer felt driven to study as a way to know Phillip. I wanted to study because I loved the poetry, because the beauty of Greek sculpture moved me..."<br /><br />The suspense part of the novel was lackluster and slow-moving. While I liked the discussion of Greek antiquities and details of the Impressionist art movement, I was never gripped with the fervent need to get to the bottom of whodonit. The sequels sound like they're set in some amazing locales; however, I don't believe I will be continuing this series.

289	__label1__	3	N	Books	1742205933	The World's Best Street Food: Where to Find it & How to Make it (Lonely Planet Street Food)	Made me nauseous	I don't know why but after seeing the images and reading this I felt like I wanted to hurl really bad. It was especially annoying since I just ate some excellent sushi and I was not about to waste a good salmon roll.

Just one pill a half hour before your meals and boom. You're losing weight and feeling better inside and out every day. At least thats the hope. For me it worked, I actually have a friend who bought them at the same time as me who hasnt had the results Ive had.. Not sure the deal but I can't be happier with what's happening with me.
291	__label1__	3	N	Baby	B004Y9AKZI	Graco Pack N Play Playard Bassinet with Automatic Folding Feet, Pasadena	easy set-up	We needed a second one (I have twin boys and they could share one when they were really young, but not anymore) and this one is a great buy for the money. All the features of Pack n Play - easy set-up, etc. for under my budget. You can hardly find one second-hand for that amount.
292	__label1__	2	N	Jewelry	B003G6EYI4	Sterling Silver Bangle Cuff Bracelet For European Style Large Hole Beads - Screw End 6.5 Inches	so uncomfortable.	This bracelet is gorgeous, but I found it so uncomfortable. I don't have large wrists, but my wrist bones do kind of stick out. No matter were I placed the cuff, it was hitting my wrist bones. I had to return it.
293	__label1__	4	N	Video DVD	6304711905	Tombstone	Best Western Movie	I absolutely love this movie!  In my opinion it is the best western movie out there.  Val Kilmer and Kurt Russell are great actors. This movie is going to get watched over and over and over.  haha
294	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00HJDIAGC	Shine Whitening Teeth Whitening Kit Bundle with 2 5cc Syringes and 2 Mouth Trays	I really feel it – slight sensitivity	I feel some stinging in my teeth every time I use this product. And I know it really works though, because I’ve seen my teeth get a lot whiter. Overall I’m happy with this, and have no major complaints.
295	__label1__	4	N	Home	B003XJC9FY	Reliable Enviromate P7 Pronto Portable 4-Bar Pressure Hand Held Steam Cleaner and Fabric Steamer	Easy to use	I use this product to steam clean our curtains, my daughter's stuffed animals/throw pillows when I can't or don't have time to wash them. Easy to use. It's easy enough to use but it tends to get a little heavy when doing larger jobs but that would be the case with any appliance.
296	__label1__	4	N	Apparel	B0073MLZ70	Alpine Swiss Mens Leather Flipout ID Wallet Bifold Trifold Hybrid Black	High-Quality Materials	Once again, dealing with them was a pleasure. It is a handsome and functional wallet, well made from high-quality materials. I expect it to give years of good service.
297	__label1__	4	N	Books	0316055433	The Goldfinch: A Novel (Pulitzer Prize for Fiction)	Deeply entertaining in a superfluous sort of way	Perhaps it's because I'm surrounded with a dense miasma of collective pop culture references all day, but I found The Goldfinch quite captivating. It's good to suspend the more intense inclinations of the mind and simply allow it to be submerged in the story. On the other hand, I can understand the disappointment that some might feel if they think that the quality did not meet their expectations.
298	__label1__	4	N	Home Improvement	B003LVZ3MU	Mark Feldstein & Associates B4PBT 4-Inch Flameless Candle Pillar with Timer and Gift Box, Green Fresh Cut Bamboo	Adds to decor	Really like these candles. Gave 2 for gifts and kept one for myself. Elegant looking and works great. Enjoying the timer option and fact that I can put in a location you would never be able to put a real candle. Put inside TV stand and adds to decor.

The fact this is waterproof is a major plus, as we do get rain and showers during the months my vegetable garden is planted and grown. I am just really happy that the squirrels and skunks don't beat me to my garden grown vegetables, and I would highly recommend this item.
300	__label1__	4	N	Kitchen	B002PY7AYS	Thermos Stainless King 16-Ounce Travel Tumbler, Midnight Blue	Worth spending the money	I never thought I would ever pay as much as $20 for a travel mug. But I really got tired of making coffee in the morning and having it be lukewarm by the time I got to work. This mug is the perfect solution. Overall a well-made product that I hope to enjoy for a long time.
301	__label1__	4	N	Home	B002BDV8DC	La Crosse Technology WT-8005U-S Atomic Digital Wall Clock with Indoor Temperature, Silver	So far it is good	The display is large enough to read from across the room, even in daylight. So far it is very accurate and is happy it has a built in battery for backup, as we sometimes get momentary power hits.
302	__label1__	4	N	PC	B007RIFKUS	ASUS SABERTOOTH Z77 LGA 1155 Intel Z77 HDMI SATA 6Gb/s USB 3.0 ATX Intel Motherboard	motherboard	I decided to spend a few extra bucks for the peace of mind of knowing this thing was going to work without hassle. Once again, ASUS didn't let me down. Put in my i7-3770k and everything started up with no problems.
303	__label1__	3	N	Watches	B0045ZUY16	GGI International Men'sLava Black Stainless Steel Lava RED LED Digital Bracelet Watch	can't really see the LED outside in sunlight	I have wanted this watch for a long time now and finally made my purchase. I didn't like that you can't really see the LED outside in sunlight. It's OK when's the sun goes down or if you're in a nightclub. I won't return it because of the cheap price and it makes a good conversational piece.
304	__label1__	4	N	Outdoors	B004060D8Y	Suunto Zoop Air/Nitrox Wrist Computer SS015964000	Nice watch...	Nice watch for my friend's kid. I received it on time and in an excellent condition. Kids like it. I would recommend this as a good item to gift someone especially kids.
305	__label1__	4	Y	Wireless	B00CC9P1K6	niceeshop(TM) Universal Mini Folding Plastic Smartphone Stand Holder (Black)+Capacitive Stylus- Black	sexy and minimalist.	i like how minimalist this stand is, it doesnt take up much space and it looks very classy as well. One thing i hate about it though is that its difficult to adjust the inclination, its because the stand its self doesnt hold especially when you have a glass table.
306	__label1__	4	N	Outdoors	B00012M5MS	Schwinn Thrasher Adult Micro Bicycle black/grey Helmet (Adult)	actually comfortable	This is actually comfortable and not at all like my last helmet which was incredibly distracting whenever my husband and I would go out cycling.
307	__label1__	1	N	Electronics	B000VEP3XO	Rocketfish Universal Wireless Rear Speaker Kit RF-WHTIB-A	Drops signal	The unit worked fine initially. However from day 2 on the signal drops every 20 minutes. I have to power cycle either the transmitter or receiver to get the units synced up again.
308	__label1__	3	N	Kitchen	B00HEYJ088	Brita 10 Cup Grand Water Pitcher with 1 Filter, BPA Free, Green	Hold it in place when pouring	This is my second Brita pitcher. The second time around I decided to go big and it is working out ok. The problem with this company is that they seem incapable of producing a lid that fits correctly. You have to hold it in place when pouring (it doesn't fit snugly; one end always sticks up). Same thing occurred with first one I owned. And yes, they were that way right out of the package. Quality control is sorely lacking at Brita. But for the price, the filter does its job so it's an acceptable product and I will keep it.
309	__label1__	4	N	Grocery	B0050NTYXG	HERSHEY'S Halloween Snack Size Assortment (36.22-Ounce Bag, 100 Pieces)	Delicious but a bit expensive	Delicious candies, it comes very well packed, so the taste of each kind of candy was good. My only complaint is that after I purchased them, I found the same package for a better price by several dollars.
310	__label1__	2	N	Kitchen	B00CBFADL8	Thermos 12 Ounce Tritan Hydration Bottle, Clone Wars	My son was disappointed	I love the Yoda design but not the functionality of this bottle. But was disappointed because it leaked after several use.

I was looking this with first interest buy this ... I can not buy this because I do not trust it. Please check the pictures, and the company website. This is not for Sprint Samsung GalaxyS3 4200mAh is not showing there. From where is this information?
312	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B001QX4GDC	Conair Professional Hair Brush Set	Not Bad	This brush isn't bad for getting through tangles, although it does stick a little when you have thicker hair. When wet, it seems to be more difficult to use. All around, the brushes are pretty decent for use on your hair.
313	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00GYF65TK	OZNaturals Eye Gel - Eye Cream For Dark Circles, Puffiness, Wrinkles - This Anti Wrinkle Eye Gel Was Voted ALLURE MAGAZINE'S Best In Beauty - The Most Effective Anti Aging Eye Cream Available!

I am in my mid twenties and really do not have any wrinkles, but I noticed that this does perk my eyes up a little and it is a great preventative for wrinkles. I trust the OZ Naturals brand!

I'm enjoying swimming more often now compared before, i hate latex and I'll never wear one again. Silicone is the thing because it's comfortable to use, doesn't wear out easily and it's cheaper. This cap is durable and very good at keep my hair dry, I love the style as well and the toughness of the silicone. I'll be recommending it to my friends!
317	__label1__	4	N	Office Products	B00006IDM7	Mead Composition Book, Wide Ruled, 9.75 x 7.50 Inch Sheet Size, Black Marble, Bookbound, 100 Sheets (09910)	Wrote down two successful business ideas on this guy!	I carry it around with me and jot down every idea that pops into my mind whenever something comes in that I dont want to forget. Ive been able to start two small (grass roots) businesses that have come up from nothing with all ideas written down in this notebook. Thanks!

320	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B007NG5UF4	VTech DM221 Safe & Sound Digital Audio Baby Monitor	Sound quality is good	This is an awesome baby monitor IF you keep it plugged in constantly, it doesn't last very long off the charger and if you shut it off the monitor, you may as well just plug it in cuz if you turn it back on, it's dead. But sound quality and everything is wonderful.
321	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00NQGWFCQ	Retinol Serum 2.5% - Anti Aging & Anti Wrinkle Face Serum to Help with Lines and Spots - Enhanced with Best Natural Hyaluronic Acid, Green Tea, Vitamin E & Jojoba Oil for Day or Night Use - Body Merry	My face is tighter and more youthful!	I use the Pro-A Serum every other day. I apply  about a dime sized amount to my face and neck after completely washing and drying my face. It has no smell at all. It is a thicker serum, almost gel like. It absorbs well into my face and doesn't leave me feeling oily. I love the results I am getting from the Pro-A serum. My skin is tighter and more firm. It feels softer and more moisturized then it has in a long time. My lines and wrinkles are going away, and I just feel younger, knowing that my face looks better.
322	__label1__	3	N	Lawn and Garden	B009Z6CW7O	Renogy 100 Watts 12 Volts Monocrystalline Solar Panel	low quality and fragile	I had high hopes when I saw that this one was of the bestselling solar panels here. I read most of the reviews here, and decided to purchase one for my house. Once they arrived, I managed to install them and for the first day I didn't had any problem - only thing was that I noticed that panels were of low quality and fragile. Second day the charge controller broke for no apparent reason, I just saw it broken and since I couldn't fix it myself -I called support - which, by the way, was not helpful. I returned the panels and asked for a refund, because they didn't wrote in the description how fragile these were :/.<br /><br />I listened to my friend's advice, who's a solar repairman, and I bought, like he did, a Suntastic Charger ( http://amzn.to/1Ad27Vf ) which I received 4 days ago. It's strange how I never experienced any problem with these - the material was good and firm - and charger was much more practical than of the Renogy.

327	__label1__	2	N	Beauty	B003RR4A2M	Turboion Rbb Croc Classic Straightener, Black Titanium Plates, 1.5 Inch	died	I used this with no problem, issues, didn't drop it, etc the day before then went to use it yesterday and it will not turn on. It just literally died. They said they have no warranty. So after only 6 months of very infrequent use, just died. Would not buy again without a warranty from a company that offered one.
328	__label1__	1	N	Baby	B0011URFRE	Graco Nautilus 3-in-1 Car Seat, Matrix	couldn't release the buckle sometimes and it's not solid...	I wouldn't recommend this baby seat to anyone who wants a safety to his kid. Once I got it, I put it into my car, because I had to drive my kid to the kindergarten, and once I arrived, the buckle just stuck - for no apparent reason. After a 3 minute fight I managed to free my kid from a seat and it was a disappointing experience. It happened 4-5 times after, so in the end I called support and asked them for help. They didn't had concrete solution, so I returned the item and got a refund.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I bought 65LX Seat ( http://amzn.to/1xthVzA ), because a colleague who had a 6 yr old kid said he bought it too and never had any problem with it. Once I got it - a week ago - I never had any problems with buckles, and since it had positive reviews here I wondered why I didn't purchase it prior to this one.
329	__label1__	4	N	Luggage	B004FMHO3U	Rockland Luggage Melbourne 3 Piece  Set, Orange, Medium	perfect ~ almost	Each luggage is perfect for everyone in my family. It is big enough and everything we need can fit on it. It is perfect for everyday get-outs or out-of-town trips. The only thing that I don't like about it is the wheels because they don't seem to be durable. I have this for 2 months already but I still don't trust the wheels. They look as if they will be broken for some time. But aside from that, everything is good already.
330	__label1__	4	N	Video Games	B009DYCTY4	PS3 250 GB Black Friday 2012 Bundle	Great price	They went out of stock in the stores nearby over night. Getting it online is the best thing to do if you don't mind waiting a little. Perfect combination of product and price too...my grandson is going to go ballistic!
331	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00557OUEU	Life-Flo Oil, Pure Almond, 16 Ounce	Good Massage Oil	I am a massage therapist and I use almond oil at my job on a daily basis. The oil really helps soothe the skin, especially when you're working with clients who are exposed to the elements a lot. I find it provides the client with a better experience overall, especially working on their backs. My ultimate forumla is to use almond oil on fair areas and jojoba oil on the rougher areas like hands, elbows, or feet. Jojoba oil is awesome- [[ASIN:B00AJFV8L6 NOW Foods Sweet Almond Oil - 16 oz. + FREE Desert Essence Pure Jojoba Oil -- 4 fl oz]]. It really helps soften the skin in those extra hard places.<br /><br />I use the stuff at home too. One dab of each oil in the morning give my hands a soft feeling throughout the day whether I'm working or not. It's great on faces and for some clients, they've told me they use it in their hair as well. The stuff is great, non-greasy, and quick to use!

333	__label1__	4	N	Home	B004U7V38W	Oil Rubbed Bronze Curved Shower Rod - NO SAWING REQUIRED	Very nice shower curtain rod	This is a very nice shower curtain rod. The color is a nice dark brown color. The only issue that I would caution is that the finish is painted on, and does scratch if you are not careful with your hooks/slides.

Very easy to use and gives great results. My face has a wonderful glow immediately after using this peel. A little goes a long way, too. An excellent in home peel!
336	__label1__	3	N	Health & Personal Care	B0071O15DO	Lipozene Diet Pills - Maximum Strength Fat Loss Formula - 1500mg - 30 Capsules	works ok	This is a good product. I have been using it exclusively for 6 months or so and saw some solid weight loss. (3-4lbs a month) I have since switched over to a product called LipoPhen which seems to work much better, and I am now seeing 7-8lbs of fat loss per month. If you are a looking for a really intense fat burner/appetite suppressant, I would check out LipoPhen [[ASIN:B00I8ULAD0 LipoPhen - Advanced Weight Loss Supplement]] or LipoDream [[ASIN:B00I8US55G LipoDream - Non-Stimulant Advanced Weight Loss Supplement and Sleep Aid]].
337	__label1__	4	Y	Kitchen	B00YFPXB9I	Cheese Grater with Storage Bag, Hand Held Parmesan Cheese Grater	Easy To Use	I'm really enjoying having a smaller hand held cheese grater. It's much easier to clean and use then my older stand up grater. I use this to grate cheese right on top of homemade pizza and salads instead of having to use the larger grater and a bowl or a plate. I also love that it is dishwasher safe and comes with a storage pouch so I don't cut my hands on it when it's in my utensil drawer.
338	__label1__	4	Y	Wireless	B00NHG0374	Coromose Smile LED USB Charger Cable for Samsung Galaxy S3 S4 I9500 (Hot Pink)	Good quality!	Good quality USB cable, such as a color change indication can tell at a glance if the full load management, but also a very reasonable price, I will have a time when they do so.

342	__label1__	4	Y	Beauty	B00D2V4UBY	Dermarie Illuminator Eye Cream & Collagen Energizer Eye Serum Anti-aging Treatment Set, 0.5 oz. / 15 g	I'm liking this cream serum combo	Used the serum for a month and like it a lot so decided to try the eye cream too. Like how you can save a few dollars by buying the set. The serum goes on silky smooth, absorbs well and not greasy. Leaves my skin feeling hydrated and moisturized all day long. Can notice an improvement in the wrinkles too. The eye cream is very nice too. Soft and absorbs nicely into my skin. Skin around my eye area looks brighter and less wrinkly. Going to buy again.

They are very basic but that is all that you'll need. They have the right format for most letters and are not that expensive.

345	__label1__	2	Y	Pet Products	B00R2Q2VS4	KONG Squeezz Crackle Ball, Medium, Colors may vary	It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat	This lasted a bit longer than the crackle bone I think simply because it is round.  It is made form light weight plastic and very easy to eat.  My girl and 11 month old puppy was able to eat this in under 10 minutes.  I was hoping it was harder plastic like the normal kong toys but not so.  If you have a chewer - don't waste the money.<br /><br />If your pup doesn't chew and just plays then I would say go for it.  But, if they are a chewer - they will eat it in short order.
346	__label1__	2	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00BZC2BE0	Protein Milkshake Vanilla Whey Protein Powder, 1 LBS, Approx 15 servings	Seems like a great company but was not impressed with the product	The powder certainly smelled sweet and vanilla-like but I wouldn't describe it as a vanilla milkshake.  The fake sugar taste was really really apparent so possibly the plain variety would be better.  Although the company was really nice to send me a sample, I was disappointed and wouldn't order this.
347	__label1__	1	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00NAV9CPA	Great Value Tech® E Series Replacement For Philips Sonicare Essence, Xtreme, Elite and Advance (4-pack)	NOT WORTH THE IMPLIED SAVINGS	These heads do not vibrate any where near as strong as the original Philips Sonicare heads.  Not worth the savings as I had to go buy a brand name repalcement from Walmart after trying these.
348	__label1__	3	Y	Kitchen	B00QMGDOCC	Fruit Infusion Water Bottle - Green	The build of the bottle as a whole is pretty solid. However	The build of the bottle as a whole  is pretty solid. However, there were a few places, specifically the juicer parts where flash plastic got in the way of using the product. The build is solid and it feels good in the hand!

I mean, whoa, did this thing really just stop working just as I was enjoying the breeze? That's just rude man.

If you don't attempt to clean it while its hot, you may as well throw it away. There is no temperature setting either so it cooks everything fast or it will leave burn marks on your food. I so wanted to like this product because I wanted to eat healthier but this product doesn't live up to expectations.

I have been using other expensive brands but came across this brand while shopping on Amazon, wish I had not made that huge mistake for falling for the reviews & cheap price. Within few minutes of applying this on my face my whole face broke out I mean major break out & my face turned all red and hot it's been a week now and I can still see patches of red dry skin on my face and forehead. I am absolutely positive that this is not pure argan oil , it is either mixed with sunflower oil or cut with other cheap mineral oils, I have never had this bad experience before with pure argan oil and I have been using argan oil for 2+ years now, the only time my skin would have a reaction or break out is if anything had either sesame oil or coconut oil in it or when the products contained mineral oils. We also noticed that this oil very thin compared to other expensive brands and my husband is researching this product and is trying to find a local lab so we can send this bottle to be tested to see what all stuff this oil contains.

You can leave the coffee pod empty and it makes a hot cup of water for tea. I've also used this product to warm up baby bottles instead of boiling water. I've used my keurig at least 3 times a day for over 2 years and haven't had one problem yet. The price is high for a coffee maker, but it literally last forever. I highly recommend this product.

I think that caffeine in this product irritated my already sensitive eyes a bit. I normally don't have any issues with Passport to Organics products, and I have found the Zinc Eye Cream to be wonderful and very moisturizing for the winter.

How do we know they actually do that? That is just sketch. Any company that did this, I just had to look further into. Check out their Krill Oil product reviews, other customers had similar complaints about fake reviews.<br /><br />SO LOOK AT ALL FAKE THE 5-STAR REVIEWS! Why have these customers only reviewed Viva Labs products, or sometimes nothing else. It's a little bit weird when you start to look at it. The easy answer is the reviews for charity donation bribe.<br /><br />Started to look into the company. Another reviewer pointed out that they were a Kentucky corporation but were foreign owned. It is easy enough to do a google search, so I did one but I did not find a facility. I only saw the generic office park. This is some sort of shell company or something? Even more strange. Where is their location at? Where do they make this stuff and where does it come from?<br /><br />Too many weird occurances for me to put it into my body.
412	__label1__	3	N	Books	0983624534	Hell	Filthy Language	The author of "Hell" seems to recognize the need for tradition if the Bible is to have any meaning at all. Think how someone entirely unfamiliar with Judaism, Christianity and the Bible would react if he read the Bible without any guidance, for the first time, in a set of unbound pages. He likely wouldn't see in it any order or unity as a book.<br /><br />In "How to Stop Believing in Hell" (on the Kindle list) the narrator describes his life and slow release from spiritual terror without reliance on any religion other than the one he is abandoning. He rejects all the usual doctrines: the existence of the will, morality, the infallibility of any book or person, immortality, the existence of the soul, eternity, Heaven, Purgatory, Armageddon, and Divine judgement. Only then does he find the love of his Creator and cease to fear Hell. It's exciting reading and can be found on Kindle's list.

It's a perfect lens for bird photography and candid photos.<br /><br />The aperture for me is not an issue because you can still produce a BOKEH when in f4.. not much but its okay.. I also tried the 70-200 f2.8 and it's way more better. It's a good telephoto lens for the price..

I find it very convenient especially in the morning because I am notorious for running late. K-cups make it really easy to measure and be on the run. Green tea is my favorite flavor and bigelow is amongst my favorite brand. I find these cups to be flavorful and not dull like so many alternatives. I also appreciate that it's not sweetened to death like some green teas.<br /><br />There are always those mornings where a little extra flavor can't hurt. Adding a dash of green tea powder {[[ASIN:B009PICJTS All Natural Organic Instant Green Tea Powder 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]} gives me the extra hit I'm looking for as well as a jolt of natural energy. I much prefer tea to coffee or other stimulants. Plus I don't have any crash which is always important. I don't need the extra always, but it's nice to have it and be able to add it accordingly without challenge.

So I got a joystick and saw that it doesn't receives any signal from helicopter. Firstly, I thought that it's because of batteries, logically, but the batteries were in, so I was confused. I told Amazon what I got and they said that I return the item and choose new one, because this one was out of stock :((.<br /><br />I choose another Helicopter which was far more better, It's Mini Radio RC Helicopter (http://amzn.to/12NArYx) which is cool and which worked from the first time I bought it :). In the end, my kid was happy to see it on air, so I was also :)).

In my first week I managed to drop 5 pounds and I was very excited because I thought I'd found my miracle pill. The week after that I actually gained 3 of those pounds back even though I was doing the exact same routine. The third week I've managed to lose 4 more pounds from where I was in week 2. It's hard to say if I'm going to get consistent results from these at this point. I'm going to go ahead and finish off the bottle and possibly try another one. For now I'm giving it 3/5 because it's clearly working and helping me lose weight, I just can't figure out why it fluctuates so damn much.

I have washed these a few times and no shrinkage at all, which is what I wanted. The cotton sheets I have been buying will shrink after a few washings making it difficult to put the fitted sheet on the bed. The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because they do not breathe like cotton and we have found them a little warm to sleep in. Other than that they are very nice sheets.

Not much, not enough to be even really concerned. It is a very effective product.    That said, I do like using this. It creates a lot of heat and perspiration. That has meant some loss of weight already, although I wonder if this is simply water, rather than the fat we are promised. Will return after more time and report my final findings. All in all, a recommended product, just make sure to use properly.

So I'm giving this 4 stars and will update to 5 if my results continue even without nutrition (I don't like changing what I eat). In any case, so far I've lost a good amount of weight and my stomach definitely looks better.<br /><br />P.S. For the one reviewer who didn't like some of the other reviews here. I bought this product on the baladea website and reviewed it since I always review my purchases here. It's not very nice to call people dishonest without any evidence. I recommend you try the product and write a comment based on that.

That being said, I feel like this one size fits all thing is not working, every time I keep finding myself pulling up the waist since it likes to sag down a bit. It has become very annoying since short skinny girls will not be able to do any good exercise like they want to. Forget about running, you will find yourself like one of those saggy pants guys that have no belts. The texture is okay but not great, surely not for the price. In the mean time I will be looking at other better designed leggings

We have read a lot about what to look for an this company, Real Spirit, put on the Internet that the machine was top of the line at a low price.  We bought it based on this information and after trying it we stopped using it because of the lack of results.  A friend of my  Wife's was over the other day and when we were talking, this subject came up.  He showed us a bunch of negative stuff online and we realized we fell for this scam.  He also showed us some other company's products and said they were certified by a USA water quality company and there were several companies like this that guaranteed their products.  Watch out for this company Air, Water and Life and boycott them.

502	__label1__	3	N	Books	0765342405	Ender's Shadow (The Shadow Series)	A pale sequal to Ender's game	Loved Ender's game. Probably one of the best book's I've read. So when I saw this in a store i thought - great, I could get to read on about Ender and his battles.  However, in order for this book to make some sense, the author had to rework the plot into the plot of Ender's Game, though it was not intented to be in it from the start. For instance, Bean states that during the great battles on Eros, he had to know where every ship was in order to be able to take over if Ender collapsed. However, in Ender's Game, Ender clearly states that the one who had overcontrol over half the fleet was Alai, who was almsot as good as Ender, according to Ender himself. In order to solve this discrepency, the author had Bean state that his performance was reduced because he had to do his part in the battles and also udnerstand the overall strategy, which explains his mediocre performance. In my opinion, this was just the author making excuses.  Not a terrible book, just not a very good one, especially considering how good Ender's Game was. The author would have madea far better job if he had written a book involving Bean five years after the events of Ender's Game, and not relive them from Bean's perspective.

506	__label1__	3	N	Wireless	B0023RRCP4	Wilson Electronics  DB Pro Indoor Cellular Signal Booster Kit for the Entire House - Retail Packaging - Gray (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install	This does not work with T-Mobile 4G! I purchased this based on the item description, which says that it works with all major cell phone companies in the US, with some listed exceptions. T-Mobile is a major cell phone company, and its network is not one of the exceptions listed. I installed it in my attic, powered it up, then spent a LONG time trying to figure out why it had no effect at all on my phone's reception. Turns out T-Mobile 4G is on a different bandwidth, though you have no way of knowing that from the description of the product on Amazon's site. (T-Mobile's 2G does work with this product.) I purchased from ANTOnline (there are different sellers for this product, depending on when you happen to buy). ANTOnline refused to give me a return RMA until Amazon intervened, and even then they took out a 15% restocking fee, which was just theft. In the process of figuring out how this technology works I talked to T-Mobile, and they sent me a free booster that actually works with their 4G network. Having tried both (Wilson's on the 2G, TMobile's on 4G) I have to conclude that Wilson's technology is falling behind: T Mobile's product is wireless (between the antenna and unit) and it was easy to install. Wilson's requires a cable between the two, and took hours to install.

I did not see any improvements once so ever.<br /><br />I bought this based on all the glowing 5 star reviews, I come to find out, and upon closer inspection that most reviews look scripted and Fake. Total waste of $$

544	__label1__	1	N	Home	B003O970PW	Frigidaire FRA086AT7 8,000 BTU Window-Mounted Compact Air Conditioner with Temperature Sensing Remote	DOES NOT WORK!!! Room stays hot no matter what!!!!	I purchased this Air Conditioner last month as a bed room air conditioner. I saw the great price, decent reviews online and boy do I regret it.<br /><br />The first thing I noticed is it's such a pain to have it fit correctly in the window. The instructions are unhelpful and do not explain anything. When I did get it to sit correctly, I noticed it would not even keep a small bedroom cool on only 80 degree days. I tried everything I possibly could but didn't get any sort of result I was looking for.<br /><br />After talking to friends and family, I finally found an air conditioner that works AMAZING!!! I have never slept better in my life now that the weather has been heating up this past month and can't wait to sleep in a cool room all summer long!<br /><br />If you want a QUALITY air conditioner, check this one out here on Amazon -----&#62; http://amzn.to/1hsKRDg<br /><br />It's not as cheap but is well worth the extra money, as it cools quickly and efficiently. Also, it's much quieter!<br /><br />If you decide it's not the air conditioner for you, at least I got to share my story about this one!

If you are using the carseat on the plane, the bag must be carried down the aisle of the plane, it is too large to roll down.

552	__label1__	4	N	Tools	B0056C6XIA	Gerber Bear Grylls Survival Tool Pack [31-001047]	It works for me!	This gerber multitool is a great toy for me! My wife purchased this for a Christmas gift, and I don't think I've been this excited over something so simple! The sheath is very well designed, with a "rubber" loop that can be attached/re-attached without taking your belt off. My preference is to put it on the Shoulder strap of my camelback (it's my new fishing buddy) for easy access. I've used every aspect of this multi tool, and it's worked great for repairing a crab pot, for taking fish hooks out of their toothy mouths, and even cutting wire. I've used the saw to cut smaller pieces of wood, have used the screw drivers, can opener, botle opener, knife and scissors without any challenges.<br /><br />The flashlight (neatly and firmly attached to the sheath) is what you would expect from a one AAA light...not long life but if used as a true back up light or for limited bursts, it will last a few months. The firesteel is awesome, as long as you have time to play with it and figure out which technique works best for you. I've started a couple of fires with it now, and through trial and error, I've learned to scrape the black finish off the steel with the file, "rough" the steel surface up with the file edge (it really helps to create better spark), and to vary pressure, speed and angle of striker to maximize the sparks.<br /><br />Once that was all figured out, it's become kind of a magic trick! I've been asked why not just use a lighter. Well, I can, but it's not nearly as much fun, and not rewarding at all!<br /><br />Pricy? perhaps... but to me, it's already paid for itself and then some!
553	__label1__	4	Y	PC	B0002AKX6Y	Mini 1LED USB Lamp Light Flexible Travel for PC Notebook	xceptional value and powerful design	Consider the project cost less than 2 pounds including delivery, although I did not expect to have a backlit keyboard, I think the extra light avaialble use my computer at night.<br />The build quality is very strong, left me a deep impression. 3 LED lamps provide adequate lighting and flexible arm very well, so far (there are two weeks, often twisted] strong proof.

It allows you to train the remote to control other devices (I added my Element TV and my DirecTV cable box/DVR). The Pulse  is small and easy to hide near your TV. I attached the Pulse to the back of TV screen. The remote is nice. It has a touch pad and QWERTY boards. It looks OK but feels great. If Pulse can put touch pad and keyboard at the same side, it will be better.<br /><br />Now I have Netflix, YouTube, Chrome, Crackle, Pandora, NYtimes, Flixster, Snagfilm.<br />There is a App spotlight, it includes a lot of apps. Most of them are linked to website. But I enjoy it since they are free and I can enjoy them on my LG TV connected via HDMI cable.I can show my picasa pictures on my big screen with Photo App. It includes picasa and Flickr since I setup picasa account only.Chrome works great with touchpad remote but it is not easier than my computer. I have to flip remote all the time.<br /><br />I have smart tv features on my old big TV with just one hundred dollars. So happy with my decision and I love my Pulse.

I purchased this product a little over 5 months ago and hardly noticed a difference... Some people that purchase weight loss items continue with their unhealthy lifestyle while using the product, but I did not. After losing a close family member to weight related issues last year, I decided to change my life for the better.<br /><br />I purchased Slim Fast after hearing great reviews from others online and in my community. I fully trusted their opinions and had high hopes for this product. I purchased it and hoped that within a few weeks, paired with an active lifestyle, that I would notice some sort of results. Two weeks passed, three, four and even six weeks later I hadn't even lost 5 pounds! If you have struggled with weight like I have, you can understand how frustrating this can be. After my experience, I really question the good reviews this product has, I have no idea how people believe this product works in any way, shape or form.<br /><br />So naturally, what did I do? I decided I had to find something else that worked. I wasn't going to let the failure of this product keep me from reaching my goal of losing 50 lbs. I searched and searched, did my due diligence and finally settled on a product that I believed gave me the best chance of reaching my goal.<br /><br />It has been three months and I have lost 42 pounds since giving up on Slim Fast and I don't regret it! I'm going to reach my goal well before the end of the month and I couldn't be happier! I have never felt so good and relieved in my life. I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long trying so many different products to still be unhappy and overweight.<br /><br />If you have went through the same emotional toll I have and need something that will get you results you need, USE THIS PRODUCT -----> http://amzn.to/1kIihbC. It is available here on Amazon and will change your life, I promise.<br /><br />You won't be disappointed. I am a walking and living example of the fact that this product works and helped me through the hardest time of my life. I hope this helps at least a few people who have struggled with weight throughout their lives.

I bought the collar as an additional training tool but as soon as I started using it I realized I would never need anything else. My dog started to respond quicker to my commands and behaved himself when he met stranger. The collar works like a charm and if it's good enough to train a male Rottweiler it should be good enough for all other breeds.

611	__label1__	1	N	Home	B00NAX7H78	Silhouette Cameo -- Starter Bundle	there's no repair center and machine goes off every 20 minutes...	Don't bother buying this cutting machine, because you'll end up with wasting a good money on something that cannot be repaired. Once I got the package, I wanted to install the machine via internet updates, and after I connected (hardly) online I download the latest software, but the problem was not in that. The problem was that, in every 20 minutes, machine goes off for no apparent reason. The worst thing is that the Silhouette repair center DOESN'T EXIST. so no one could repair this machine. I ended up as returning this item to Amazon...<br /><br />Once I got a refund, I bought Cricut Explore ( http://amzn.to/13Njs94 ) cutting machine which was far more better than Silhoutte version. I didn't had any problems in installing it and the fact that it comes with battery that last for 2-3 hours is really something that beats Silhouette version :).

Once I got them I noticed a hard focus - I couldn't set a proper distance, one which would be proper for my eyesight and binoculars. The more troubling problem was that there was some scratch inside the optics, so every object around me looked fuzzy. This was really a hard disappointing experience for me, so I asked for a refund.<br /><br />However I bought a Bushnell Binoculars (http://amzn.to/13xDW5q), because of a friendly suggestion.

Water isn't pumped up to the TOP of the filter like COMPETITOR PRODUCTS.  Several reviewers compensate for the top of the filter being dry by rotating it 180º each time they fill the jug.  This wouldn't be necessary IF there was a pump that pumped water from the tank to the TOP of the filter.<br /><br />2.

When I was doing my photo shoot last week, I decided to use these instead of my Opteka reflectors.  And guess what?  They work about the same, except the Neewer reflectors are a whole lot cheaper.  And the way they direct the light on my models when I'm shooting is wonderful.  I was taken by the first photo, and I expect to be using these for a long time.  The only thing I hate is fooling with the zipper on the tote bag.  It's not faulty; you just have to take your time to line the zipper up and it will work every time.  So, if you want professional quality reflectors at an affordable price, these are it.

665	__label1__	4	N	Baby	B004X0WBHS	Bright Starts Clack and Slide Activity Ball	Not Quite What I Expected	When I first purchased this product, I was under the assumption it would be a great teething toy for my 6 month old girl.  The toy had a variety of shapes and contrasting colors sure to keep my child occupied for a while.  After a few weeks of playing with the toy, I realized my baby didn't have much interest in it anymore.  First of all, the toy requires more motor skills than most 6 month olds have.  The squeaky ball sometimes gets stuck and makes it hard to push the squeaker.  The toy is also real heavy, and I'm concerned it will fall on my child's face when she's lying down trying to play with it.  Her foot also gets stuck between the bars when she's really active. The paint on the caterpillar started coming off by the time she reached 8 months old.  It's okay to use if your child is actually interested in it and able to maneuver it. However, it seems that by the time your child is actually old enough to do the toy some justice, all interest in playing with it is gone.  As far as a teething toy is concerned, I would have rather invested in a rattler.

671	__label1__	1	N	Sports	B00169CU66	Total Gym XLS – Universal Home Gym for Total Body Workout	Watch out! READ THIS BEFORE BUYING PLEASE!!!	I thought this would be a good investment a couple months ago, but I was wrong...<br /><br />The first main issue I noticed with this set is that the bolts tend to loosen during use and when it happened to me, part of the frame bent because it wasn't supported properly anymore.<br /><br />The parts seem too cheap to be on a machine that costs $500+, which makes me even wonder why it costs so much. Not only that, but it is also very loud during use and smells like a chemical plastic spell.<br /><br />After I had to deal with this, I did some research and found an home gym I was more confident would be better and exactly what I was looking for. Luckily it has been the best machine I've ever used to work out with!<br /><br />It doesn't have any of the issues I mentioned above and I can't find a thing to complain about in over a month!<br /><br />I got it here on Amazon too -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1r7KMGa<br /><br />You won't regret getting that setup, but if you don't get it, at least I could warn you about this one after my experience!

But with that being said, my weight has always fluctuated quite a bit so it's hard to tell whether Garcinia really is as life changing for me as many other users are reporting. Maybe it's my metabolism or my eating habits (I usually skip breakfast and lunch, but go by on coffee until a light meal around 3pm and then eat a bigger meal in the evening). I started taking the Garcinia with my main evening meal but so far I can't tell whether it has really helped me. I will give it another month and then maybe switch to green coffee bean extract.

The splash guard is almost non-existent and the opening for the potty is very small. My son is at the top of the growth chart for his height and weight. In order to get any use from the almost non-existent splash guard, he has to sit too far back on the potty and because the opening of the potty is very small, his bottom is part way off the potty.

Also, while you can't tell from the photo (where it looks short), the wire / cable from the main box to that toggle is pretty long (about 6 feet). Yet another little pleasant surprise: the button has a rubberized bottom so it doesn't slide around easily on the desktop.

754	__label1__	4	N	Kitchen	B004VF0G3G	LG LCSP1110ST 1.1 Cu Ft Counter Top Combo Microwave and Baking Oven, Stainless Steel	Perfect for a Bachelor or Bachelorette	This microwave came with plastic shrink wrapped over it. Sort of a thick shrink wrap which you have to remove. It's hard to tell it's there and it's a chore to get off. In fact, it appears they shrink wrapped the parts before they put it together, because the plastic stuff is in the seems where the oven is put together and that you can't get out. I never would have noticed it was there, but it covers the vents.<br /><br />Okay, once the thick plastic wrap is off, how does the microwave perform? As good as any other and it's attractive, but it's small, the interior I mean. I expected larger. The pizza oven could be bigger. The large frozen pizzas we get at Safeway are too big for it. Still, cut them in half and it performs okay. It's perfect for the ones we get at Costco. All in all, this microwave does the job, but I don't think I'd recommend it for someone who cooks a lot, because of it's size. But for a bachelor or bachelorette, it'd be perfect.

Carrots came out only in short slices and zucchinis became mangled stuck together, and I just couldn't get it to work like advertized. The blades look dull, and the Vegetti appears to be made from very cheap plastic; I don't know how long before this thing breaks. I guess you get what you pay for, but with what I know now I wouldn't even spend $10 on it.

This painting is my serenity. Perfect for the bedroom and relaxation time.

After a long stressful day at work, or as part as my meditation, this never fails me. It takes me to a dreamland while I am still awake. Having the extra added mini waterfall really brings out this artwork to an even larger scale of reality.

Moving forward with my recent healthy lifestyle I decided I wanted to monitor my weight. After looking through reviews I decided this was the one I wanted. Although, I found out it is not what I was looking for.<br /><br />First off, I tested the scale by placing a specified weight on it and each time it would miss the actual weight by 2-4 pounds being either higher or lower...<br /><br />This was pretty frustrating because sometimes even the smallest drop in weight makes me happy and keeps me motivated. I wanted something that would be accurate every time I stepped on it. I dealt with this for a little while before doing serious research and getting a scale that I LOVE.<br /><br />I have owned it for over a month now and can say it is accurate every single time! I check it every so often with a weight to be sure and it has never been wrong.<br /><br />I actually ordered it here on Amazon ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1lKSlNc<br /><br />This thing is magnificent! I hope I could help others by sharing my experience.

They said that the goggles are perfect and the straps adjustment is very easy. They liked the blue color very much because it is their favorite color. As they are using them for some time now, they didn't broke and the quality didn't change. I liked the one year quality guarantee, it is a great offer but I didn't use it till now. The visibility is very good for outdoor usage while it is not as good when used indoor, and this is why I gave it 4 stars. Over all, they are well made where they protect the eyes perfectly.

This speaker was supposed to just let us play some tunes while enjoying a day of fishing, but it performs even better than what I thought. The volume goes so high, people by the shore could hear it and they were probably 2 km away!

I followed the instructions in the handbook, which there weren't many of to start with. The cam never got a picture, never recorded. I followed the trouble shooting suggestions and they didn't work.

I had to replace some tools with mine but nothing serious.

I'm constantly getting my ankles taped to play basketball, need to immobilize my ankles. It definitely beats the nasty white most athletes use that leaves a mess after you take it off. Since it's called Fidowrap, I'm guessing it's for dogs? It didn't really make a difference for me, but I did use the white tape to mummify my dog for halloween. Worked great, didn't come off.

That said if you are not into serious cooking the set will do quite nicely. If a friend is looking for a cheap set for not heavy duty cooking I will recommend this product. Otherwise look some more.

I was pleasantly surprised with the workmanship of the product when it arrived. However the assembly instructions, left something to be desired. I ended up putting the bass thing together multiple times: first i had used the wrong tension rods and didnt know until i got to assembling 1 of the Toms, then I had leftover washers and realized they should have been placed on those tension rods. I still have a few pieces that I'm not sure where they go.

The only problem I have with HP cartridges is that they run out so fast and you have to keep replacing the entire cartridge.

If you drink a lot of tea, then the packaging is perfect for you. Everyone in my family drink iced tea so it is nice to be able to quickly have a cup hot or cold, both are delicous. I would also recommend this iced tea mix, [[ASIN:B009PIEW3O 100% Pure Instant Iced Tea Powder (Unsweetened) 8 oz. - Buy One Get One Free!]]. It comes in a resealable foil bag so whether you want to make a bunch or just a cup its quick and easy to do.

The problem though is that the noise it makes is extremely distracting. It's like playing close to a huge room fan.To be fair though, I have to emphasize that it does keep the heat away for long period of time.

I have been looking for a solution that allows me to distribute music wirelessly. Some of the systems that I found from Logitech and Sonos were out of my budget. Also, Logitech stopped making their product. So I gave this transmitter a try. I am very pleased with the wireless range. I was a bit concerned given the small size of the transmitter unit. However, this set performed quite well in every scenario that I tried. I have located the receiver in all of my rooms and I am getting clean reception. What I like is that I can get addition receivers to place in multiple rooms. I don't know how many transmitters can be used at the same time but apparently they use a smart pairing feature that allows several transmitters to run within the same home. I don't really need the iPod cradle but this is a nice extra feature.

909	__label1__	2	N	Books	0061995045	The Upside of Irrationality: The Unexpected Benefits of Defying Logic	Better, But Not Excellent	Interesting book. It is better than &#34;Predictably Irrational.&#34; Indeed, people are often irrational, but sometimes what appears to be rational is not. But even in this book, Ariely misses one of the obvious and major reasons people make SEEMINGLY irrational decisions, that are actually quite reasonable and rational from an individual perspective. Our government has increasingly alienated people from individual responsibility and from other citizens, and it has taken the risk out of making decisions.<br /><br />As long as they receive government benefits and hand-outs, most citizens will not look behind the &#34;wizard's curtain.&#34; Nevertheless, modern U.S. Government is unlike any before. Citizens can observe that government is now nothing more than an unsustainable Ponzi scheme. A broad tax base of new taxpayers is needed every year just to pay basic government expenses. Yet, each year, the tax base shrinks (population of taxpayers decreases) and government expenses rise. In the face of this disaster, has government made an all-out effort to cut expenses? Of course not. Government is raising taxes to dangerous and debilitating levels, borrowing huge amounts of money from foreigners, and INCREASING EXPENSES. Obama has quadrupled-down on failure, creating the largest deficit ever. If a private citizen or corporation ran its affairs in this manner, it would be criminally procescuted for fraud.<br /><br />Citizens have internalized the government's ongoing propaganda-of-irresponsibility, and they observe the government's example of irrationality and emotionalism. And now the People are behaving just like their government. This is what government &#34;nudging&#34; has created.<br /><br />For over 60 years now, citizens have been detached from the effects of their negative decisions, whether concerning lifestyle or the effects of bad financial choices. With a constant barrage of government-sponsored propaganda; emotionalism and group-politics have replaced rationality as the bases for decision-making. And modern U.S. government propaganda is the most effective in history, as it employs all the lessons learned and techniques of behavior manipulation from the disciplines of sociology, psychological warfare, and psychology over the past 100 years. There are ongoing propaganda programs promoting and encouraging government provided medical care, unemployment insurance, welfare and social security benefits, free monthly income even for young people, and the chance of filing a lawsuit or getting the government involved when investments go bad. The government conditions citizens to incorrectly believe that correlation is the same as causation; and that appearances and emotional intent are the same as results. The government's goal: promote reliance on government and avoidance of individual responsibility, thought and judgment. Why? To insure ease of public manipulation and the political power of certain groups. Obama oligarch, Cass Sunstein, refers to this conditioning, manipulation and control of citizens as &#34;nudging.&#34;<br /><br />For example, during the recent &#34;subprime mortgage crisis,&#34; which Ariely cites as an example of irrationality, all parties behaved rationally and reasonably, EXCEPT the supposedly rational U.S. Government. Homeowners who could not afford houses knew the government was guaranteeing the loans and, given their minimal down payments, they knew they had little to lose from foreclosure if they could not make payments. Thus, it made perfect sense from their perspective to risk buying homes they could not afford. Similarly, lenders knew the loans were government guaranteed, and the government was threatening lenders with lawsuits and fines if they did not make loans to unqualified buyers, so the lenders knew they had little risk in making imprudent loans. In fact, lenders faced greater risk from government harassment if they did NOT make imprudent loans. Investors in those loans also acted rationally. They understood, correctly, that the government would not allow homeowners, lenders and investors to lose billions or trillions of dollars on a program the government forced on the country. Thus, investors bought loans they knew would probably go into default, because, even if they received no payments from borrowers, the government would rescue financial institutions and investors, which it did. Finally, the only party that did not act rationally was the U.S. government. First, it &#34;incentivized&#34; imprudent economic activity by taking the risk from lenders, borrowers and investors. Then, to make matters much worse, it actually rewarded and has now promoted imprudent financial activity by rescuing all parties to the government created mortgage &#34;crisis.&#34;<br /><br />Over the past 60 years, governments have aggressively promoted irrational risk-taking (which is actually rational for the individual, since he risks nothing), which has spread to all areas of individual human endeavor. Citizens are increasingly losing their good judgment, since the world in which they live is a fiction created by the government, bearing no relation to the real world of finance, economics, and survival based on good decisions. Thus, contrary to Ariely's thesis, the forces of &#34;irrationality&#34; are not hidden. Irrationality is a necessary part of modern government. In fact, many of the programs created by the government have the irrational and exact opposite effect than the one intended. For example, the 1960s &#34;Great Society&#34; and &#34;War on Poverty,&#34; created more poverty. The War on Gun Ownership has resulted in more violence by criminals. The welfare system designed to help families, destroyed families, and created several generations of illegitimate children. Despite billions spent on education; Math, Science and intelligence testing scores are in decline. This is because foolish government bureaucrats and academics have confused correlation with causation. Education does not make people successful. Rather, successful, intelligent people are more likely to finish their education and continue on with their successful lives. It is a waste of money to try to over-educate an unintelligent individual, who should be directed to trade training. Instead, politicians tell us it is preferable students receive diluted, fake degrees. Amazingly, not only does the government not encourage the most intelligent and productive citizens to have children, but instead, the government now subsidizes and promotes the breeding of the least intelligent inhabitants of the country. Incredibly, in many cases, the people receiving these breeding subsidies are not even citizens! There is insufficient space here for a complete list of government irrationalities.<br /><br />It is enough to note that modern government employs techniques similar to the &#34;Cargo Cult&#34; islanders who, by using sympathetic magic, thought that creating the superficial appearances of a system (fake airport and planes), would bring material reward (delivery of cargo). Like modern politicians, the Cargo Cult confused correlation with causation. Citizens have learned the lessons of government irrationality and it has conditioned individual behavior. Many academics and intellectuals, such as Ariely, have lost sight of the fact that human beings are animals that respond in ways that are similar to organisms and other animals. That is, they seek the easiest path to satisfaction of needs and emotions, and avoid effort and thought whenever possible. This is particularly true of individuals subjected to prolonged government propaganda campaigns. Government cannot force one to be successful, but it can set up conditions promoting irrationality and failure, as the U.S. has done. The best antidote to predictable government irrationality is to place individuals back in touch with reality, that is, with the true effects of their decisions. Despite Ariely's faulty analysis, hedoes unwittingly show the many ways in which government directly and indirectly promotes irrationality.

927	__label1__	3	N	Beauty	B00CP4H3T0	Philips Norelco PT724/41 Shaver 3100 (Packaging May Vary)	decent for price but you get what you pay for	If you can afford a better one I would recommend doing it. I can go into a long review but I don't see the need, you get what you pay for. This razor feels cheap. The heads are not very flexible and the groomer is not very sturdy.  It's a pain to clean and it cannot get wet. I have bought many electric razors and I can tell you that this will get the job done but like I said before, get a better one if you can afford it.

I have tried all settings, Locations and indoor and outdoor. Sensitivity is way to high turn them all the way down and they pick up the shadow of my flag waiving in front yard. If you like watching birds it will pick them up as they fly away lol. If you want to watch your baby this is perfect if you want to stay up all night. What a fail GE.

Some reviews suggested taking it with food and water, so I did. I can't give a fair comment on weight loss effects because I feel  I wasn't on it long enough. Though I didn't lose a pound,  I moderately exercise everyday. Don't feel it really suppressed my appetite either. I gave product 3 stars because it may work for someone else. If you are sensitive to caffeine, then I suggest you don't try it.

He loves it, but the nose and eyes are made of that iron on material that's on so many shirts that will crack and peel. That was okay because it normally lasts for a while, but even before he wore it the first time the nose was already cracking off. Pretty poor quality there. He doesn't care, he still loves it, but it's still kind of irritating. Also, the strings are really short. I know it's for boys, but it fit on both my head and my grandma's head, but the strings looked ridiculously short, even on my little brother (who is 7).

I've had it for 3 years and the battery is still great. I even use this for gaming and it still runs smoothly. I had problems with it when I first bought it. The charging circuit wouldn't work and they had to replace it. But after that, it ran smoothly. The laptop can run Adobe Photoshop CS5 but lags a little. It's good enough for a student like me. 3 years ago, laptops were pricey and this fit my budget.<br /><br />My Cons:<br />It's too damn heavy if you want to bring it anywhere. My back hurts a lot after carrying it the whole day. It heats up really fast if you're gaming or programming. I actually got burns before when it got too hot and it was seated in my lap. The touchpad is annoying too, sometimes it moves itself even if I'm not even near it, but it happens rarely.

I bought this for my son and he thinks the flames are &#34;cool.&#34; It's easy to get him buckled and he can pretty much do it by himself. The only thing I wish it had was a cup holder but we bought this for our second vehicle so we probably wouldn't use that much anyways.

If you can catch it before it spills over completely, you will find when eating that the noodles all gravitate to the bottom and you are left with a very untasty, pasty noodle mash at the end of the serving.

991	__label1__	4	N	Books	0767903579	Falling Leaves: The Memoir of an Unwanted Chinese Daughter	Abusive	Adeline Yen Mah tells an interesting story of culture, abuse, and commitment. This was a new look for me at Chinese heritage. As a daughter from a wealthy Chinese family, she gives insight into the abuse that knows no economic boundary. She had a cruel Eurasian mother that added a whole new element to the traditional family. Adeline eventually moves from China to England and then to the US while trying to preserve her family ties back home. It was an interesting look at three cultures and how they affect our image of family. It was an interesting read but be prepared for a terribly abusive story.

I am trying to control my dog who hasn't learned obedience commands is exhausting and often nearly impossible. But teaching him simple commands from this book will make a world of difference and provide a great opportunity for bonding. So thankful for this book that is so much helpful. I have learned to keep in mind that puppies have short attention spans, and it is unreasonable to expect to have your puppy's full attention for a long period of time. Keep your sessions short at first to minimize distractions and maintain your dog's attention, gradually increasing the amount of time spent on training each day.

I expected something like 50 pounds in a couple of months and instead I only lost 28 pounds in two months. I know that is still A LOT.<br /><br />On the other hand I never lost so much weight before as I did by taking this supplement. I didn't have a single side effect. No headaches, diarrhea or chest pains like other weight loss stuff make you have. Oh and I didn't have flatulence either. Some other pills I took caused me that a lot.<br /><br />So, this is actually a great product, I'm just an impatient guy. It took me years to get this fat and I want to get rid of it in months. I know that is crazy and it is my fault not the products.<br /><br />I think people should buy it and be patient with it. Even if it takes three months to lose all the weight it is worth it because you live longer when you lose the weight and are thin. Thin people don't get some diseases as often as fat people do. You don't get diabetes type II and you don't get high blood pressure as often.<br /><br />If people in your family have that stuff you need to be thin to not get it. So, buy these raspberry ketones before it is too late for your health.

10502	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00ICAKJJW	Power Wheels Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kawasaki KFX	Great fun for little ones. But be sure you fully charge before use.	This is probably one of the most exciting gifts you can give to a young child. Most kids are fascinated with the concept of driving. So having a little vehicle they can safely maneuver is awesome. We purchased this type of vehicle for all 3 of my kids. Everyone of them was thrilled. In fact, we parked them inside the garage facing forward as though they were &#34;parked&#34;.<br />This one sits a little high, so the child has to climb up to get on it. But they won't mind.<br />I would highly recommend elbow pads and a helmet. Though we've not seen our 4 wheeler turn over on us yet, but there were a couple of times going over some big bumps on the hilly areas that it looked as though it might tip. So steer your kids away from really bumpy areas and stay on mostly level ground. This is not a TRUE 4 wheeler. It is not designed for rough terrain. It is a TOY.<br />When it first arrives at your house, it might be best not to let the little ones know it's there. It has to be partly assembled and charge overnight (you have to plug it in) before it can be used. If you charge it less than the recommended time, the battery will never hold a charge for long.<br />Being that it runs on an oversize battery, it's only good for about 20 minutes of constant riding before it starts to lose some power.

My eyes tend to get really dry and itchy. I have a habit of rubbing my eyes, which just makes them worse. I've started using these drops when I feel the urge to rub my eyes, and they are great. They are soothing going in and my eyes don't feel dry or itchy for a while afterwards. I probably use them about 3 - 4 times a day, sometimes more when the weather is really dry. Now I just wish they made Similasan sinus drops.

We've unfortunately dropped the phone several times already, even on the concrete garage floor no damage and very minimal scuffing of the case.<br />Camera and buttons are all accessible with no interference from the shell.<br />Comfortable in the hand texture-wise.<br /><br />My only real beef is the price.  It seems customers get bent over the barrel a bit when a new iPhone comes out.  An equivalent new-android phone case can be gotten for less than half the price, and tempered glass screen protectors are routinely under ten bucks.  The &#34;layers of radial impact geometry&#34; seems kind of gimmicky, when the other pure silicon Speck and off-brand cases I've owned have done as well of a job.

This system is so much nicer and does not have a use by date so I am guessing it will last longer than the Continental system. In addition the Continental system will damage the Tire Pressure Monitors in your wheel where the Slime system says it will not. It has a nice light and is easy to use. I am hoping I never need it but it is comforting to know I have it in my Corvette which does not have a spare tire. It came fairly quicky and has a nice carry case with a reflective triangle on the back of the case to place while you are fixing the tire.

It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn's plastic snap closure.<br /><br />Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier, while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.<br />But...Oxo can be rolled up for travel.

Sadly, though they have faded down a bit because of the Drive 2.0 & 3.0 collections, where they have catered so much on the young, that the appeal of their class has died in the process. But they are trying to make a returning stance in great appeal watches. This WDR Eco-Drive watch is definitely a great return to the appeal Citizen had been known for throughout the years. What I also like about the watch is the excellent illumination on the hands, and the globe-style face on the watch. It definitely stands up very well. It is a elequent piece that looks great, and keeps great time on the wrist, without much worry. I suggest you go for this dark-tone piece, and see why Citizen for years has been known as being a world class.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: B 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: B

Not just in style, but the quality has gotten better with the time they have made with the way we view time. Their Seiko Sportura watches are definitely in the ranking. This watch is a very simple and easy to care leather-strapped watch. I personally like how simple it is to read the stopwatch setting with the comfort of the strap around my wrist. It is a very strong watch that does what it is worth, and protects great  in water. I definitely recommend this watch if you are looking for a great watch that is sporty, and fine like china while telling time. Seiko has done that for years, and the Sportura is definitely following in suit like their other models have.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Comfort: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

I bought this for my hairless Chinese Crested dog and had to take him to the vet.  Do your homework about dog sunscreens because some have toxic ingredients like this one(Benzophenone-3) which can cause contact eczema & absorbs into the body and does not process out.  Zinc oxide is toxic for dogs.Harmful ingredients are triethanolamine, Imidura, Methyl Paraben, DMDM Hydantoin.  Titanium dioxide is a good ingredient but the SAFEST is organic sunscreens for babies containing sunflower/jojoba seed oils, green tea leaf extracts, calendula flower/gingko leaf extracts, aloe juice, vitamin E, with titanium dioxide.  I'm looking at some brands at a local Whole Foods store which should be good.  Read the label carefully and I hope this helps you choose wisely.

Included is a chain guard, a user manual and a wrench conveniently stored in the handle of the saw. The battery was not fully charged but nearly so and took a short time to bring it up to a full charge. All I had to do was add some bar and chain oil and the saw was ready to go.<br /><br />There have been a number of storms the past few months and they broke off numerous branches and downed one very large tree. I have been doing some cleanup with a Stihl gas powered saw and a 40 volt Ryobi. They do a fairly nice job on the branches but not so good on the big tree. I slipped on my goggles and hauled this bad boy out to the big tree.  I started of with the trunk size of about 14 inches. This saw was nothing less than amazing as it cut through the tree trunk like a hot knife through butter. I continued until the tree was cut up and then worked on some branches and some trimming. This saw never slowed down and the battery just kept on keeping on.<br /><br />This is now my saw of choice. No more mixing oil and gas for the Stihl and no more charging the battery for the Ryobi. From now on it is just charge the Greenworks battery and keep a supply of bar and chain oil on hand.<br /><br />Yes, this saw does dribble a bit of oil as did the Ryobi and as did every chainsaw I ever owned. That is no big deal. All you need to do is slip some old newspaper or some rags or whatever under the saw when storing it and then check the oil level before the next use and you are good to go.

10529	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B00BLORPGG	Baofeng 2013 Newest Dual Band VHF and UHF Walkie Talkie, 5-watt, Black	Great for the price	I've been an Amateur Radio Operator for many years, and have more radios than I'll ever need. But when I see these Baofeng radios for under $50, I can't help myself. I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.<br /><br />Performance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.<br /><br />This is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price!!<br />Very good audio on TX and RX.<br />Good battery life.<br />Good sensitivity and selectivity.<br />Great features.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.<br />Programming cable not included.<br />Very quirky programming without the cable.<br />Channel skip is only available using the programming software.<br />SMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.<br />Very slow scan speed.
10530	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B00DOMOCCI	The Reservoir, Emergency Water Storage System 100 Gallons	100-gallon Bathtub Water Emergency Preparedness System "The Reservoir"	This is a very handy Preparedness option if you want to fill your bathtub with safe, potable drinking water (in advance, while water pressure is still available). These are widely offered all over the Internet at prices from $18 up. These are essentially just giant vinyl bags with a nozzle/cap closure. The same exact bag seems to be sold under various brand names, but it's the same product.    I like this simple concept. Here are some points to consider:    1. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Once full (even partially full), this thing will weigh a ton. Completely full, 100 gallons weighs 800 pounds.  It's not portable. You're not going to be lifting it out of the tub and carrying it anywhere. The vinyl would likely not survive 800 lbs of stress even if you had the manpower to lift it.    2. Once it's in place and full, your bathtub (and/or shower) are out of action and can't be used for anything else...like bathing, or decontaminating anything. So this works best if you have multiple bathrooms/tubs in order to spare one for water storage.    3. These are one-time-use items. Once you use it, and empty it, the vinyl bag is just too large to dry thoroughly after it's emptied. So there's that. On the other hand, 100 gallons of water (at 1 gallon per person per day) is a great resource.    4. If portability is a concern, you can achieve much the same thing using clean large plastic storage bins (Sterilite brand or similar) and stacking those in the tub. Same concept but capable of being moved if necessary.    SUMMARY: If you have a bathtub you can afford to dedicate solely to water storage in an emergency, this is a fast, easy, simple and clever solution to hold 90 days+ of survival water for one person, 45+ days for 2 people, etc. It pays to comparison shop on price. It's large, and a challenge to dry to dry out hygienically for possible re-use (consider a blow dryer and a funnel?), so I consider this a 100-gallon 'disposable'. On the whole, at around $20, this is a great solution at a low price for 100 gallons. Just make sure you have a tub you are willing to dedicate solely to water storage.    Hope this is helpful. Stay safe and happy trails, everybody.    PS: I just read reviewer Jennifer Gonzales's comments that people often overlook that they already have a ready source of clean emergency water in their home water heater. That's very true, and good to remember. There are lots of good how-to videos on YouTube on this--you'll just need to know in advance which valves are involved, and most units will need a crescent wrench to open the faucet type drain at the base of the heater.
10531	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B0066T2IAY	Fossil Men's JR1357 Nate Chronograph Black Leather Watch	Beautiful large watch with easy to read clean face	As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.<br /><br />The band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.<br /><br />The watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the "start/stop" timer function.  The lower button is the "reset" button once you've stopped the timer.<br /><br />One of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.<br /><br />This is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.<br /><br />4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing.

10534	__label2__	4	N	Toys	B00IQ8MTH0	Fisher-Price Little People Place Musical Preschool Playset	A fun preschool set!	I rated Fisher Price Little People set 4 stars because it is a cute musical preschool play set. I am generally happy with all the Little People sets I have and this is a great addition. I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting!<br /><br />The magical color rug doesn't really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; &#34;It's time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!&#34;<br /><br />I didn't rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I'll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a &#34;new&#34; feeling toy.<br /><br />Overall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play. If your looking to add to your current collection or just start one of Little Poeple play sets, this is a good one!
10535	__label2__	2	N	Tools	B00203U69K	Power Spin	Melts when a power tool is used	After my hand got tired I connected the cordless drill to turn this at medium speed.  After a while, this got so hot, it melted the plastic and warped it so bad the Rigid "Power" Spin was destroyed.  This should be renamed to "Flimsy Melt" Spin instead.  A drain cleaner that can be powered by drill or motor should always be made of metal, not plastic.  I recommend General Pipe Cleaners R-25SM instead, which is built MUCH tougher and still reasonably priced.

Allows 2.5 gallons a minute.  I'm a woman, and installation was easy.  I've installed a few already, and as long as you have plumber's tape, you're good to go. You will not be able to adjust the flow or spray type, but I found it to be more that adequate.

They are really bright and 20 come made up in one component.  I'll drive them with a Solar charged battery and little wind generator and turn them on and off with a motion PIR controller.  This is one of the best bargains in LED lighting I have found.  Very much worth the money paid.  Very satisfied.  Can be purchased in bulk at a considerable savings per 20 strip units of Three little LEDs per strip.  Get one and play with it. The plastic, which absorbs heat and then melts needs to be removed and replace with something to remove the heat, air circulation is a must.

But it's equally intriguing to see him hold back in her presence.<br />Jon Foster, Russell Crowe, and the other cast members do well in their roles, although the motives as mentioned above may leave you scratching your head.
10541	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B00BI9MDSO	AmazonBasics Heavy-Duty Vault Case for PlayStation Vita and Vita Slim (Officially Licensed by Sony)	Solid case	This is a really good case and I feel like my Vita would be adequately protected if I were to drop this case (not that I'd TRY, mind you, but I feel secure with it in this case).<br /><br />That said,  I have a couple of wishes:<br /><br />1.  The case can hold 3 game cartridges and 1 memory card.  I WISH that it could hold 6 and no memory card.  I have a 32 GB card and I don't intend on switching these out.<br />2.  I wish it had a detachable strap...even a hand strap would be great.  The case is fairly large and carrying it for extended periods means you need to have a secure grip on it.<br /><br />Other than that, top marks - great case!
10542	__label2__	5	N	Beauty	B001CSOBWW	MAKE UP FOR EVER Smoky Lash	Great mascara.	I love this mascara. Black is super black, lashes get volume, length and stayed curled (but I use eyelash curler before).<br />There is no flaking at the end of the day.<br />The only thing is that less is better-I use it first on the end of lashes and if I feel like I want more dramatic look apply one more coat from the bottom of the lashes. But usually 1 coat is enough.<br /><br />Waterproof Smoky lashes is excellent too, truly water resistant (have to wait till is dry to go the pool).

I have however noticed the price went up on all their products after it was featured on Shark Tank, what a shame.
10544	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00JX9HMXM	V8: V-Fusion Peach Mango Juice, 46 Fl Oz(Pack of 4)	Tasty and Healthy ~ Great with Seltzer, Too!	If you are wanting to get more vegetables in your diet, these fusion drinks which combine fruit juices with vegetable juices are a savvy way to do so. This peach mango mixes the juice of sweet potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and yellow carrots with the juice of white grapes, apples, oranges, peaches and mango puree. You really taste the peach-mango flavor with the other subtle flavors as nuances.<br /><br />It is 100% juice with no ADDED sugar. However, it does include natural fruit sugar, as all juices do, which is part of the fruit juice - 26g sugar in a one cup serving. What I like to do is use about 1/8 cup - which would be about 3.5g of fruit sugar and 20 calories - and put it in a cup of seltzer with ice to make a refreshing and healthy drink. One cup of this fruit-vegetable fusion drink is 120 calories, but you can dilute it with seltzer to give it fizz and less calories for a refreshing, healthy and tasty beverage. It provides 100% of daily vitamin C and 20% vitamin A in one serving.<br /><br />It's a great concept to mix fruit and vegetable juices in a healthy fusion drink like this which is naturally delicious. Of all the V8fusion drinks, this is one of my favorites. Mango and peach together are so refreshing and rather tropical tasting.
10545	__label2__	5	Y	Books	0062202715	Nothing Gold Can Stay: Stories	Interesting, Intriguing and Often Surprising	I enjoyed each and every one of these stories. Ron Rash has a way with words and his stories are interesting, intriguing and often surprising.<br /><br />In The Trusty, a prisoner gets loose and with the help of a woman he sees his way to freedom only to have things turn on him in the end.<br /><br />In Cherokee, Danny goes to a casino hoping to win enough money to pay off his debt. He and his wife check in to the hotel and Danny carefully plays the slot machines.<br /><br />A man who considers himself a 'Servant of History' looks into the etiology of songs. His search for these beginnings ends up turning around and harming him.<br /><br />Those Who Are Dead Are Only Now Forgiven was one of my favorite stories in the collection. A college student is in love with Lauren who has turned into a meth-head. He tries to free her from her addiction but ends up giving himself to her and her demons.<br /><br />The Dowry is another of my favorites. A family is totally against the marriage of their daughter and is about to kill her fiance when a pastor steps in to make things right and evens up the score.<br /><br />All of the stories have panache and I read them aloud to my husband as we were driving. It was great to hear the words spoken and to share the book with someone else. It is a welcome addition to Rash's repertoire of works and I plan to read his other short stories soon. For those of you who enjoyed 'Serena', these stories will not be disappointing.
10546	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B004D4SW5O	ViSalus Body By Vi Challenge Shape Kit, 48 meals, 10 mix-ins	I love these shakes	I have never been a big fan of custom diets.  I have tried many before and got tired of the same thing over and over again.  I had some friends that were part of the cult that is ViSalus and kept trying to sell me on the product.  I finally broke down and bought it on Amazon instead of through them because it was cheaper and I am not being bothered to reorder and such.  Now for the product review:<br /><br />I love these shakes.  I am moderately active to begin with.  I play baseball once a week, I like to go outside and do yard work and I also have a woodshop that involves carrying heavy pieces of machinery and lumber around.  However I was 6'0&#34; and 205 pounds and really needed to drop some weight.  I thought 10 or 20 pounds would be good and I'd be fine.  Well after losing 20 in just a little over 2 months, I am now almost down 30 in just over 3 months and very happy with the results.<br /><br />It tells you to drink 2 shakes a day and a sensible meal but let's be honest, we humans love food.  I did the opposite of what everyone tells you, which is to get on the scale once a week or once a month.  I get on everyday.  Morning and night.  I really wanted to track my habits and how I lost each day.<br /><br />I found the best thing for me is a bowl of Quaker Oatmeal in the morning (brown sugar maple), a shake for lunch (look on pinterest and find shake recipes), and a sensible meal like a turkey sandwich or wrap or salad or something at night.  If I wanted a snack I will eat something like an apple with peanut butter or some Special K cracker chips or something healthy.  I was not extremely careful in calorie counting but I do go over my options and choose the best one.  Don't get me wrong, you will want food, food, and more food while on this diet.  Just as you will with any diet.<br /><br />The shakes are not that great by themselves.  Tastes like a typical protein shake.  I mix it with almond milk and other ingredients and come up with a less than 200 calorieshake that tastes great.  My favorite for instance is 2 scoops of powder, one cup of almond milk, 1 tablespoon of PB2(look this stuff up, it's awesome), 1 tablespoon of chocolate Fat free Jello pudding mix, and one teaspoon of caramel flavoring.  Throw in a handful of ice cubes and blend and it tastes like a snickers.  As I said before, you can look on pinterest or other sites and find recipes for different shake flavors that are great and PB2 instead of peanut butter provides half the calories and fat.<br /><br />So all in all, I would highly recommend this diet for someone that knows how to stick to a diet.  I lost 20 pounds in over 2 months with no time at the gym.  After that 20 it was a little harder to lose so I now work out about 3 times a week and I feel and look great.  I am still losing but I am also adding muscle so I don't notice the weight drop as much but it's still there.  All with just one shake a day instead of 2.
10547	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B00B9J319S	Alpatronix 4-in-1 Protective PU Leather Classic Black Case for Apple iPad 4 Retina Display and iPad 3 with Built-In Stand: Auto Sleep Smart Cover Function / All Ports Easily Accessible / Lightweight / Slim Fit with Soft Interior Lining and Leather Protection Against Stains, Scratches and Splash. Great for use at Home, Work, Travel and Outdoors. Exclusive 1-Year Warranty (Comes In Retail Packaging)	Great Value	This case is a nice value for the money. It certainly isn't the fanciest case out there, but it is very nice considering the low cost.<br /><br />When &#34;tenting&#34; your ipad there are 4 different options for height, so you have plenty of options for positioning. The cover latches closed and does not come off on its own - a feature I appreciate when travelling with the ipad. I don't have to worry about something being able to get in contact with the screen and scratching it. They way the ipad fits into the case is also secure, so you do not need to worry about your ipad falling out of the case.
10548	__label2__	4	N	Home	B00A2VND0Q	Eureka AirSpeed Pet Bagless Upright Vacuum, AS1002A	Strong Suction, light to push	I found this vacuum easy to put together.  It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.<br /><br />It IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.<br /><br />Features I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers.<br /><br /> Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range. I've used it about a month and haven't noticed a decrease, if it doesn't last over time, I'll update this review.<br /><br />MY DISLIKES:  It's bulky and big to store, and it is heavy.  While this is not a problem PUSHING it, it might be if you need to carry it around. Replacement filters for the HEPA filtration system might be expensive.  I wish the cord was retractable.  I don't see a way to turn the brushes off for hardwood floors.

10551	__label2__	5	Y	Beauty	B008HBMRRS	Burt's Bees Intense Hydration Day Lotion, 1.8 Ounces	Perfectly moisturized	My new favorite face lotion. I was a long time user of Olay, but the changed the formula of my usual brand and I didn't like the perfumy odor. My skin is sensitive to begin with so I'm always reluctant to try another brand--it's usually 50/50 as to whether my skin will break out. I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well. Having used Burt's Bees products before I took a chance. I am so glad I did. It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in. I have been using it for almost a month and NO break outs. In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized. You also do not need to use a lot. One pump is all you need, and even that a little too much...so I just rub the excess on my hands. I am very impressed by this lotion. I did not expect it to feel this good and most importantly no residue!

10553	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00062N428	German EKG Caliper	great for fine woodworking and precision joinery	I got these on a whim.  I needed a set of accurate dividers for fine woodworking projects that involved copying and transfering small measurements - at the level of a few thousandths.  The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn't want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.<br /><br />These calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5", but the effective usable span is more like 7", so they're not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado's, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn't matter much.<br /><br />At $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I'm familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don't do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.<br /><br />This might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.

This makes them stand too far off of the wheel rim.<br />Combine with the valve stem, the thickness of the light unit, plus the plastic light tube, and this could only really be used on a very small wheel.  Using on 26&#34; wheels, these bend off to the side, back and forth.<br /><br />Also, these are all plastic, with poor clearances.  You won't keep water, dust, and air off of the valves with these.
10555	__label2__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B00IR99G7Y	#1 Barbecue Grill Light with 10 Super Bright LED Lights - Durable, Weather Resistant, Versatile LED BBQ Lights for Outdoor Grilling (Black)	BBQ's best invention (if only it was weather proof!)	[[VIDEOID:8712406df7dc5717aaeb927ed7c07d07]] No more burned meat! This happens way too much: I awkwardly shine a flashlight on my steak, it looks done, I bring it inside, cut it open... and it still needs another 5 minutes.  This light has saved me much annoyance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It actually fits perfectly on my BBQ.  I was very stoked.<br />- Lights up the entire grill with brilliant blue LED light.<br />- Comes with 3 AA batteries in box (not all companies do that! But obviously Brigmon does!)<br />- Black color stays out-of-sight (as opposed to a bright white colored light)<br />- Once installed it stays secure.<br />- The people at Brigmon are very nice folks (they're the ones who sent me this light to review and test. A lot of sellers sell this light on Amazon, but I would suggest going through these nice folks.)(no I don't work for them... they really are friendly).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Have to take it off/on if you're not using it (see note below).<br /><br />Note: If you live in a warm climate (e.g. CA or AZ), then by all means this is a must-have.  However for my personal use here in the PNW weather, I must take this on/off to use it because I don't want it to get ruined in the rain. Or if you have a rain cover, just tuck this underneath (if it fits).<br /><br />Overall, a 4/5 stars product.  Really if you love to BBQ, this is a must-have toy.  (I guess it'd make a great gift too)

I put a different pad on it though because the one that comes with it is a bit like a sponge and I didn't want to come to the tree and sit on a wet sponge. I didn't actually test its porosity but it sure looks like a sponge and I didn't want to find out the hard way.

I have small lady hands and found the small size not too tight, but tight enough to provide moderate compression. The only problem is that the gloves get a bit sweaty and stick to hands when being pulled off  (unlike the other brand I bought on Amazon last year). I also got a bit of a rash in the base of my thumb, probably from sweat. But the warmth does help with arthritis.

It keeps my laptop nice and steady while computing on the sofa.  Very innovative design with lots of positions possible.  I've already settled on my favorite.  The numbers on the pivot points really help with remembering alternate configurations.  The fans are a bit noisy at times but nothing terrible. The side platform is nice to have but I decided not to use it just yet. The 2 plastic clamps go along the bottom edge and help hold your laptop in place when tilting the table at extreme angles.  It's lightweight but feels durable. Should have got this long ago.

I have used the conditioner and leave in treatment in this hair care line and love both.  I was excited to test this specially formulated shampoo as well.  Once I received it and read the label I was very disappointed to learn this contains sulfates the evil enemy of Keratin users.<br />This suds up nicely and smells great.  My hair was left feeling clean, yet I had that sinking feeling I was damaging my hair.  I'll continue to use the conditioner and leave in treatment, but I'm sticking with no sulfate, no suds shampoos.
10565	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B00C1LIYWM	Safe Haven	Nicholas Sparks Romance with Just a Little Bit of Mystery	Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />“Safe Haven” is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallström (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance “Dear John” a few years ago), “Safe Haven” is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For “Safe Haven” attempts to be a “mystery” – in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie’s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.

My opinion is that it is purchased by the company from a vendor who also sells this exact bulb to Feit and a few others (such as what is available at the large name home repair shops).  Diecast heat-sinks and  a good lens make for a nice bulb. I'm happy with my purchase and at this price definitely recommend it.

My video says it all and shows how to piggyback this compressor.  You'll see that I hold this rig on a hand truck, which makes it easy to move around. I can still pull the compressor off the hand truck easily, for times when I don't need to extra tank and just want to put the compressor in the truck or something like that.

10570	__label2__	5	N	Furniture	B00IKWTLC8	Chelsea DSW Molded Plastic Dining Side Chairs (Set of 2) (White, DSW Side Chair)	Comfy, easy to assemble and great for any room.	Extra chairs are something I've been in need of for a while. Something versatile is always good, and these chairs from Chelsea Eames Style certainly fit the bill. They can be assembled in minutes, are pretty sturdy and are comfortable to sit in for any length of time. Looking at them in the stock images, they might not look like much. When you're sitting in one, however, you might want to switch out your old computer desk chair for one of these. Plastic chairs will probably always look 'kiddy' no matter how you look at it, appearing as the kind of thing you'd see in an elementary school. I actually like how the chairs look in-person, and wouldn't be against getting another set because of how reliable they are.<br /><br />The chairs come packed in one box, and in a way where it's practically impossible for them to get damaged during shipping. They have little foam covers on the screw holes, and all the tools are included in a little bag, one taped to each chair. Yep, everything you need to assemble these is included! Assembly only takes a couple of minutes once everything is out of the box. The instructions are easy to follow- you'll have it down after the first chair and not need them for the second. Once they're set, put them where you want and get sitting!<br /><br />There's not much else I can say aside from the fact that they're comfy. The backs have a bit of give so you can lean back a little, and they're very light, making transporting them a breeze. Cleaning them up is equally easy, them being plastic and all. My home has hardwood floors and there haven't been any scratches from the legs when they've been moved or bumped.<br /><br />I got a pair in black, mainly because I felt they'd look better over time with use. Both the white and red are good colors too, and it could be fun to get one set in each color. These things deserve the high review rating.
10571	__label2__	5	N	PC	B00HZR4EEE	OCZ Storage Solutions Vertex 460 Series 240GB SATA III 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive (SSD) With Acronis True Image HD Cloning Software- VTX460-25SAT3-240G	solid, fast mid-sized SSD	A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a "I love my SSD" sticker.<br /><br />Write performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes ("dd" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place.<br /><br />The "sweet spot" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious).<br /><br />The OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage.<br /><br />A fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba. Recommended.

Installs very firmly on my gas block and lines up perfectly with the front sight.

10580	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B000795XMY	K&H Manufacturing Deluxe Kitty Sill With Bolster Tan Kitty Print 14-Inch by 24-Inch	Wonderful perch!	We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable.  Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<br /><br />There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<br /><br />The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.
10581	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00PTL3TKI	Graco Contender 65 Convertible Car Seat, Chili Red	Compact, fair price, will last from infant to about 3 years old.	This car seat seems like a decent inexpensive solution for your child.    Pros:  - Small, can fit in the middle of a small sedan and still fit 2 adults at either side without much hassle.  - Easy to install... Some other car seats leave a lot to be desired.  - Will last from 5 to 40 pounds, which is about from birth till about 3 years of age. (obviously varies depending on child, this is just a rough estimate) This is for back facing carseat.  - Goes up to 65 pounds for forward facing.  - Buckles work fine. My other Graco had buckles "voluntarily recalled" this one has the newer styles already, so I don't foresee a recall. They are easy to adjust and to buckle  on or off.    Cons  - I have other Graco car seats, and the cushion/fabric seems like it's better quality than this. This was a small disappointment.    Overall, if you are looking for a first carseat, and got less than 150 to spend, this is a good choice.

10583	__label2__	5	N	Watches	B007EHOAS0	Stuhrling Original Men's 168S.33151 "Classic" Stainless Steel Automatic Watch with Leather Band	A beautiful watch, 2 different band colors, but one design flaw may or may not be important to tyou	This is actually a beautiful piece, especially if you have a guy who usually prefers a sports watch but sometimes needs a dress watch for dressier occasions. This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.<br /><br />Better yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.<br /><br />I personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.<br /><br />The face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.<br /><br />That said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.<br /><br />But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.

When it has came down to Citizen watches, they have been both a hit and a miss in regards to their value. They have had a huge hit with making classic and distinctive watches, and have a big miss when it has came down to catering to younger horologists with timepieces. Their Drive collection has honestly lagged in terms of design and distinction as well as quality for the long-term owner of a timepiece. This timepiece from Citizen, actually does more to confuse the owner than drive in regards to the overall value of the piece. It does have a lovely leather strap and significant movement, but that is really all there is to it. What I do not like about the watch is that you see the watch in 3 directions. The second display seems much bigger on the watch, while the regular time display, and the military display seem much smaller and weaker on the watch. Overall, it is a noble watch, but there are better ones Citizen has made overall for the money.<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: C+<br /><br />Overall: C

10592	__label2__	4	N	Office Products	B00P9SI8IE	iGearPro Multifunctional Voice Recorder - Portable Rechargeable Digital Audio Dictaphone - MP3 Player (8GB)	More Useful as an MP3 Player than a WAV Recorder	I received a free item to review.  The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range.

10594	__label2__	1	Y	Sports	B001IEKZDO	Omron Home Blood Pressure Kit Large, Blue/Black - 104MAJ	Don't expect this to last even a year.  They don't make replacement parts, so you'll have to buy another one soon.	Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1&#34;, and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13&#34; cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts

10596	__label2__	5	Y	Home Improvement	B000HE7YQM	M-D Building Products 1025 All-Climate Auto and Marine 17-Feet Weather Seal Strip, Black	Highly versatile weather seal	Looking over these reviews you see a wide variety of applications for this versatile weather seal.  My two uses to date:    1.)  Insulation for the door of this humidor - [[ASIN:B005KLQURG Havana Cigar Cafe Display Humidor]].  I found that sponge rubber weatherstripping compressed too much in a short period of time and was not providing the necessary seal.  This rubber weather seal worked out perfectly for this application.    2.)  Bed rail fastener gasket - this is a much less conventional use for this product but it was effective for me.  My bed has a wooden head and foot board with wooden side rails that fasten to the foot/head boards with metal hardware.  With movement on the bed the friction of the side rails against the head/foot boards resulted in a distracting squeaking sound.  I used this rubber weather seal as a gasket where these pieces meet and it eliminated the noise.  In fact, I can't believe just how well it worked for this purpose and suggest you give it a try if you encounter this same annoyance.    I purchased this in September of 2014 and paid $6.99.  I'm very happy with the performance of this product.

It's almost certain that I will inadvertently leave it on from time to time, draining battery life.<br /><br />I borrowed my daughter's 10&#34; pad to see about the functionality, and we agreed that the tablet holding &#34;stretchy bands&#34; worked better than it initially appeared would be the case, and the weight of her pad nicely balanced the easel function.  Without a pad inserted, it had seemed far less stable.<br /><br />The case closes to a secure and thin unit that offers moderate protection.  Again, not bad.<br /><br />Writing this, I've already had keys stick a few times, creating text liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike this.<br /><br />The instant &#34;Tap Launch&#34; feature is a nicely considered one, as are the iconographic function keys at the top of the keyboard,but overall the KeyFolio is going to offer a mixed bag of helpful features and needless frustrations to the user.  i'd say wait for the next version of this model.

10600	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00M552Q0K	Michael Nyman: Make it Louder, Please! [Blu-ray]	Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself	Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself<br /><br />For some reason, music stores and concert programs file British composer Michael Nyman under “Classical Music”. I find this interesting because that’s not really what Nyman’s music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for “The Piano” and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a “classical composer”?<br /><br />Next is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his “pieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nyman’s work is fast and he “borrows” tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nyman’s work.<br /><br />This wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthaus’s intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nyman’s tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled “Musicologist Scorse”. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nyman’s “hits” (but not “The Piano” and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus – for those not familiar with the composer – is a 52-minute film “Michael Nyman – Composer in Progress” from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but it’s nice to have it here as a bonus.<br /><br />If you are a Nyman fan like me, you’ll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the “portrait” first and then the concert.<br />The BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”

10603	__label2__	3	N	Video Games	B006PP41Q8	PlayStation Vita Travel Pouch	Great if it's on sale.	Coming it at nearly twice the thickness of the PS Vita itself, Sony probably means "put it in your luggage" when they say "travel pouch". It's padded reasonably well for being transported in luggage, a laptop bag, etc., but I'm not sure I'd want it to be a standalone case.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this in person before ordering, so I was a little surprised by how soft the case is -- not only in feel, but construction. It just isn't going to stand up to too much.<br /><br />The interior divider does a great job of holding games, but isn't stitched all the way through, so there's some risk of hard objects one one side scratching the other side, if the divider shifts too much. Similarly, I definitely wouldn't want to use this for carrying around much more than a USB cable, cleaning cloth, and some games. Fitting the AC adapter and power cord in the pouch is possible, I guess, but I'd be really concerned about the plug scratching my Vita.<br /><br />Amazon usually has this for almost half off MSRP, which is a very nice deal. At full price though, I can't say I'd recommend this.

But they have never stopped letting go what made them a great watch company for over 100 years, class and diversity. That shows well in this luxurious diamond piece. It is easy to setup diamond-studed quartz piece, that sets up nicely and fits well around the wrist. It also is very easy to read and understand the time. The one thing I really didn't like about the piece is that it has both a 24 hr. subdial and a vertex with the A.M./P.M. indicator, where it could've shown the day of the week as well, where the hour glimpse is done once too much. But you firmly get a great watch for its money well, and I recommend this piece from Bulova for any man who wants the bling for their bucks.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

Slower cards don't let me take as many pictures in quick sequence.  I also have a Samsung EVO class card.  Its speed ratings are slower than this card, but for my purposes I can't tell the difference in speed (both cards are fast enough for my camera).  The Samsung is slightly cheaper and comes with an adapter.  I recommend it over this card because of the price difference unless you need the extra speed this card offers.

Providing a 30 day &#34;home retreat&#34; in the appendix, as well as an additional reading list, the book contains both practical advice and practical approach.  Wicks moves perspectives from psychology to spirituality in a way that doesn't quite mesh well, and as noted, the message gets a little redundant - which may belie both the simplicity and difficulty of the task at hand - namely the management and elimination of the head trash that holds us back from personal and professional growth.  The book is OK - but there are more interesting self-help type books out there.

I have had the one speaker version of these for about 6 months. It has held up well and worked great. I use it in a training room a work where there is no stereo. Hook it to my phone and it works great.<br /><br />This two speaker version is a bit louder than one speaker and as the room I use it in is around 25'x35' it does help a bit. It still won't fill the room with sound but it is an improvement. In a smaller room, like my office which is maybe 15'x 15' it can almost be to loud.<br /><br />even at full volume the sound is decent and there isn't a lot of crackling. Bass is of course lacking in comparison to a large system but that is to be expected. They do include a carrying case and the speakers themselves compress and lock to about half their size when not in use. They hold a charge for hours and charge quickly. the cord to charge and connect to a phone is included although no wall outlet adapter is.<br /><br />Overall these seem well made, are compact, have good sound, and if you need something you can use on the go they are great. Even if you just want a cheap bedroom solution ot use with a smartphone and pandora, etc....these a decent.

I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn't quite for one reason - the buttons.<br /><br />To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room.  To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace.  The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern.  The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room.  So those don't get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes.<br /><br />So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well.  The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED's now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I'm in just fine.  But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don't provide enough light.  That's about the only time I usually turn on the others.<br /><br />I thought if I had a remote for them, I'd be more likely to use them when needed for other things.<br /><br />This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location.  The others were just too bulky to fit within the &#34;standard&#34; box the builders used here for the wall switch.  This is the first that fit, and it didn't even have to be crammed in there.  It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer.<br /><br />The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more.  Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on.<br /><br />The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote.<br /><br />It works well.  I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness.  The &#34;favorite&#34; raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time,  The remote is responsive and accurate - I've not had any misfires.<br /><br />Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons.  I really hate the feel of them.  There's a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions.  So it always feels like it's about to come loose or something.  They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges.  The other downside is that there is no &#34;favorite&#34; or &#34;last&#34; setting for the wall switch itself.  I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that's just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch.  This one doesn't have the same functionality unfortunately.<br /><br />My other wishlist item would've been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark.  But the LED's are only on if the light is on.  The whole &#34;raised icon&#34; to &#34;easily find in the dark&#34; really seems pretty useless to me - if you've already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you've ALREADY found the switch...<br /><br />Apparently the CFL's I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off.  This wouldn't even work with them as a simple on/off switch.  But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED's, as these were the only cans left that I hadn't swapped to LED yet.<br /><br />But as I said, this is the first switch I've tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall.  It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.

This Amazon item sells various remnants (i.e. left-overs from longer hoses) so what you get is not necessarily matches the stock photo. I am attaching a photo (under customer photos) of the hose I received - a green light-duty 3-ply hose. It looks just like many longer hoses I bought a local home improvement store. It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.<br /><br />The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo. However, after several days in the sun with water running through the hose the kinks are working themselves out and the water flow is not impeded significantly.<br /><br />Overall, I am pleased with this purchase.<br /><br />Ali Julia review

10632	__label2__	4	N	Books	1594204365	Year Zero: A History of 1945 (Ala Notable Books for Adults)	To begin again	1945 is year zero, the year in which the real battle for peace began in many ways. Ian Buruma sets out to write a history of that year; but more than that - he examines the aftermath of the war. Little known facts and incidents populate this book, even if one has been a frequent reader of this time period's history. At points a reader can be caught off guard by some of the comparisons. The celebration of VE Day is compared to Beatle mania. The structure of his writing can also be confusing in places. He writes about Germany and then in the next sentence of Japan, without a comparison or a break in the organization.<br /><br />Much of the study is not so much about the rebuilding after the war, but the horrors still inflicted on the people that survived and their fight to survive the peace. Even rations were cut in Britain after the armistice. The retributions of soldiers and civilians, the rejection of soldiers returning by friends and relatives are examined. We learn of graves opened in the search for valuables and gold teeth, and dead crows for sale for food. This is not really the reconstruction, but the roadblocks that came after the war.<br /><br />This is a hard read, to know of the killings and revenge that fill its pages. It is, in many places a tough view of human behavior; but we also see the very hard attempts to bring the shattered countries and people back to a semblance of normal life. There is an outstanding analysis of the British electorates' rejection of Churchill.<br /><br />Still, even with the choppiness in some of the writing and of various sentence structures; this is still a must read for those who wish to learn of the time after WWII and the attempt to make peace, despite the terrors many faced. Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list.

I bought it and set it up with no problem. However, to fully enjoy a movie I need subtitles. This player, to my utmost surprise, does not support subtitles. I cannot use it and that is the reason for my one star rating.<br /><br />If you are interested in this item I suggest you read the review by Jean Luc, which I unfortunately failed to do prior to the purchase. This is the most comprehensive and informative review I have seen. It will be a majorr aid in your decision as to making the purchase. This review lists the numerous pros and cons and if I had read it I would not have purchased this item because lack of subtitle/CC support is identified. If you don''t need subtitles then this may be the player for you. One big plus is that it does not require a credit card to start off with such as the Roku 2 XS 1080P does. I tried the Roku and it was so bad I had to send it back. I wil keep the Sony in hopes that a subtitle upgrade is in the future. Wishful thinking, I know.

10636	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B00862522A	NEW! Replacement Upgrade Headband Comfort Cushion Pad in Leatherette with snap locks. Universal fit most Headphone models; Grado SR SRi-series, Sennheiser HD-series, Beyerdynamic and more.	Great looks and fit; as durable as the original	Got this to replace the aging headband on my [[ASIN:B0006NL5SM Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms]]. It does this just fine, in good style comparable to the original.  Pros: * Look is very similar to the original (one more snap, same color) * Fit is a tiny bit tight, but it does go on OK * Length is perfect * The cushioning is nice; I don't feel the headphones' weight up there at all  Cons: * The material feels delicate, like it'll probably wear out faster than the original; time will tell * The underside material (what contacts the metal band) is not nearly as durable as the material in the original, which is quite tough. This may never become an issue, but given how the DT 770's adjustment never stays put, this could manifest in some internal tears.  Other thoughts: * For the price, a nice replacement headband. I'll update periodically as it ages to note how it has performed. So far so good.  Followup: Nine months in, and I'm upping to 5-star because it's lasting, taking normal use and minor abuse like falling prey to cat shenanigans. No rips and tears, still soft.  Followup -- Oct 2015: still going strong, no tears, no snags. I am impressed and have amended my earlier concerns about not being heavy-duty. It has taken daily use for quite a while, and hasn't shredded.

The toner cartridge I received was an "Office Depot" brand reconditioned toner cartridge and not anything connected to HP as the manufacturer.<br /><br />If I wanted a refilled used laser toner cartridge I would have bought one and at a much lower cost than this one is selling at - hence my surprise to see I was sent a refilled cartridge.

They're just the right small size for everyday and I find that they're ideal when I am wearing an attention-getting necklace or bracelet as they don't steal the spotlight at all.

The directions also say you must wash your hands after use so I am sure the cleaner must have a lot of strong chemicals. I prefer using milder cleaners. On the other hand, the main reason I bought this item is that I was hoping it was refillable, and it is!

You'd think after the Halloween 4 mess in the expensive Halloween boxed set, they would get it right in the Nightbreed boxed set, which us UBER expensive if you consider it's only 3 discs of ONE movie.<br /><br />I purposely went for the boxed set to get both the director's cut AND the theatrical cut on Blu-ray so I could upgrade my theatrical from the DVD. But when I watched the Blu-ray of the theatrical cut, instead of the 5.1 audio track that was promised on the back of the box, I could only get a 2-channel stereo track. Knowing my DVD of the movie has a 5.1 track, I figured maybe there was a problem with my Blu-ray. So I posted my issue on the Scream Factory facebook page, and they were kind enough to respond to the post:<br /><br />Sorry but there is not a 5.1 track on the theatrical cut on all discs. We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed.<br /><br />The misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience. As much as I appreciate all the work Scream Factory does bringing rare films or cuts of films to Blu-ray, it really disappoints when it doesn't deliver on the easiest part--giving the best possible features when they are already available elsewhere!

Sure, the busy bars entertained my maltese and poodle mix, but not this toy in the beginning.  I gave this toy one last chance to be useful.. and then I finally found out how to use this toy to dispense treats! My dogs love beef liver cubes. I cut the cubes into tiny pieces, small enough to fit down the tube of this toy. Then, I used the Pupperoni treats to plug up the small holes on the sides, and a really big piece of Pupperoni or a beef liver cube to plug up the large end of the tube. With this formula, this toy is now a success! It exhausts and challenges the dogs! It usually takes them quite a while to get all the treats out. Hooray! :) Yeah, if I didn't figure out this technique sooner, then I would have tossed this toy for sure.  So far, this toy has been very durable. Its lasted longer than our tire-based toys.

I purchased these locks to keep my 2 year old out of our cabinets. They were almost impossible to install. It must be my cabinets or something but it took forever. I had to lay inside the cabinets and move things a millimeter this way and that until they finally started locking. I also needed to fold some small pieces of paper on the underside of the front of the locks in order for them to stick out enough to catch. It took me about 2 hours to get 4 locks in place. Now that they're installed they work great. They keep the cabinets completely closed. You can't even get a finger in there. To open them you just put the magnet on the door and that's it. Simple design and they work great. They're pretty strong as well. I could probably pull pretty hard and break them but there's no way my toddler could.

Excellent size, handy soap/lotion dispenser by OXO. As usual, OXO has designed a helpful product. I wanted to put together my own hand soap, using olive oil and aloe vera, plus lemon and a little antibacterial soap. It was easy to do with this dispenser, because it has a very wide opening which made it easy to pour in the contents. It was easy to rinse out, and very simple to use. Now I'm enjoying my own hand soap, playing around with the thickness until I get it just right. I'll probably end up buying a huge bottle of my favorite lemon hand soap as soon as I get tired of experimenting. Either way will work fine in this dispenser.

10660	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B00DZW1CDO	Ernie Ball MVP, Most Valuable Pedal	Very Well Made / More Expressive Options Than a Fixed Sweep Pedal	There are a number of models in Ernie Ball’s pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing.  To be clear, I’m talking about the MVP 6162 – the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There’s no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn’t specify, based on performance it’s a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models – best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups.  I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn’t using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will – I’m not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise/interference here - just practical 'off').  The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume ‘floor’ – meaning if you don’t want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal’s full-heel position.  Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you’re at the level you want,  can be a real convenience (and your sound person/recording engineer will thank you – even if it’s yourself).  At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive:  it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you’ve only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep – and you wished for either a ‘tighter’ or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options.  In case you’re wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an ‘anti-volume’ pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum.  I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away).  Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle – especially if I’m doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn’t be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way.  The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer  that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn’t is a side-to-side tone pot function – granted it’s cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it’s there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn’t detect much loss with the MVP – although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation.  The MVP’s 3/16” brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice ‘tooth’ to it that’s comfortable to use wearing shoes or not.  The min/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios.  I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it’s hinged otherwise it would just scream ‘lose me!’. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn’t come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels.  If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal’s internal components under the foot control – too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out.  I can’t comment on the tuner jack function (I’m old school tuning fork and ears).  Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals.  And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated.  I’ll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on.

Though in truth, I'd probably use my own scaling knife, but that is a neat touch to have on hand in case one can't find the more specialized tool (which happens all to often to me).    -- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.

10664	__label2__	3	Y	Video Games	B002I0GEXM	Disney Epic Mickey - Nintendo Wii	Beautiful graphics, lackluster gaming	Like a lot of gamers, I was very impressed by the early footage from Epic Mickey and Warren Specter's enthusiasm for the project. However, upon playing it, I'm decidedly mixed.<br /><br />THE GOOD<br /><br />The game is visually beautiful, really pushing the Wii's graphical capabilities above and beyond. The cutscenes look incredible, like a real cartoon. The levels are absolutely brimming with visual treats - no boring fields of grass or carbon copies of the same building repeated over and over. Look closely and you'll spot some cool Mickey paraphernalia in some levels.<br /><br />Using old cartoon strips as settings for the 2-D levels is ingenious. It's too bad they don't go on longer and only serve as transitional levels.<br /><br />There is some replay value. There are a lot of pins, which might interest players who like collecting Disney pins in real life. More interesting are the unlockable cartoon reels and concept art.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />The gameplay. It just isn't that exciting. It seems the game was torn between appealing to kids and holding the interests of adult gamers. Epic Mickey was billed as a platformer, but the never reaches anything as exciting as the Mario games. There's some jumping, there are some decent moments, but it's mostly just fetch quests where you have to find an item for somebody. However, the fetch quests often seem forced as they come at random times from people who aren't well developed characters (there are exceptions - I liked Horace the Detective).<br /><br />Other reviewers have criticized the camera system and I do agree. It's not a deal breaker, but there are times when it refuses to give you a clear view of what you need to see.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br /><br />The game is too hard for kids, too easy for adults. I think this game would have benefitted greatly from allowing the user to adjust the difficult setting.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD<br /><br />At the end of the day, there's a lot of potential in Epic Mickey,but I can't really say it's a great game. It's probably one of the better third-party games for the Wii, but that's not saying a whole lot. I will probably try Epic Mickey 2 because Warren Specter seems aware of Epic Mickey's flaws, but I won't be rushing to get it on Day One.
10665	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00D2D1WVI	Jesse Stone: The Complete Set	Soulful Detective Series	If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.<br /><br />Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?<br /><br />In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.<br /><br />In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.<br /><br />This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.
10666	__label2__	5	N	Books	1423184629	Far From You	Great book for fans of Veronica Mars.	Sophie Winters is a drug addict. Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren’t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.<br /><br />But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.

It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend the book.

10670	__label2__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00F5NB7JK	Roku 1 Streaming Media Player (2710R)	Love this little black box	We've had our Roku over a year now and are quite satisfied with it.  We had a little trouble getting it installed as we have a Samsung tv and they seem to have their own set of instructions and my husband and I are not the brightest on computer gibberish instructions.  But once installed, all is good.  We can now get Netflix which always has something to watch and  of course Amazon Prime has a lot of different shows to watch.  There are several avenues to sign up for that have even more variety but they do come with an additional fee, as does Netflix.  One CAN get too much variety and get addicted to just sitting like lumps of lard on a cold plate and not accomplishing anything at all!<br /><br />It's funny that we now watch several tv series that my husband had made snap judgements on when they first appeared on tv and said they wouldn't be any good and wouldn't watch them, but now thinks they're just great and watches 3 and 4 episodes at a time.  Such as Blacklist. Men can sometimes be so frustrating.  I could just pinch his head off at times!<br /><br />The little remote that comes with Roku is very easy to operate and the actual receiver box that attaches to the tv is very small and unobtrusive.  I don't think anyone could go wrong with the Roku 2710R.

They contain a &#34;fluoropolymer&#34; similar to, if not the same as, &#34;Teflon&#34; which is a trademarked brand name.I shoot a lot. It works well and does seem to impregnate into the surface of the metal hopefully providing protection and lubrication in the event you get caught without lube. Other than that I can't say it works any better than any other quality lube for day to day operation. I am still using it, though, so I must be liking it some.
10675	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B00AEFYQE2	No Strings Attached	Not funny, without any romantism included, wasting two good actors, this is almost the "level zero" of romantic comedies	I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a &#34;sex only - no strings attached&#34; common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.<br /><br />The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since &#34;Ghostbusters&#34; in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.<br /><br />The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...<br /><br />I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;My boss's daughter&#34; and &#34;A lot like love&#34;) and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of &#34;Notting Hill&#34;, &#34;While you were sleeping&#34;, &#34;When Harry meets Sally&#34; or &#34;Must love dogs&#34; - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of &#34;A lot like love&#34; (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!

Since R2D2 is shorter than the figures of Luke Skywalker and others (which &#34;are&#34; 6 inches tall) the R2D2 has to be half their height to be proportional...Make sense???

10679	__label2__	4	N	Books	1878424076	Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul	Can anyone please check the dog pound?	Together with "The Seth Material", "Seth speaks" is the most well-known book featuring Seth starring himself. Apparently, this book pretty much started the New Age channelling craze. Seth is a multi-dimensional, spiritual personality from another plane of existence, who periodically speaks through the mouth of medium Jane Roberts (whom he calls Ruburt).<br /><br />Now, that sentence should really be in the past tense, since Roberts is deceased, but Seth claims that time doesn't really exist, so I might as well speak in the present tense, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />I tend to avoid channelled material, but the few items I somehow managed to sift through were quite different from "Seth speaks". This book blends incredibly dense, pseudo-philosophical and boring prose with a strange and much welcome sense of humour. In general, the channelled spirits seem to take themselves far too seriously! Seth makes slips of the tongue (at one point forgetting the number of chapters he has dictated), has a love-hate relationship with cats, claims to have lost his dog somewhere on our planet, and seems fond of beer! He also insists on starting every other sentence with the words "Now". At one point he jokingly refers to himself as a ghostwriter...<br /><br />As for Seth's message, it's another version of New Age thinking - I sometimes wonder how many versions there might be out there?<br /><br />God isn't a person, but an ever-evolving Consciousness, referred to by Seth as All That Is. Time as we know it doesn't exist. An almost infinite number of alternate realities co-exist simultaneously. (In some parallel universe, Seth's dog presumably wasn't taken by the dog-catcher.) Strictly speaking, reincarnation therefore doesn't exist either, since all our "previous lives" exist at the same time. We are all multi-dimensional personalities, living on many different planes of existence, constantly evolving in innumerable directions. We are also somehow part of God, who is the ultimate multi-dimensional entity. Weirdly for a system that lacks time, All That Is nevertheless evolves and constantly creates new forms. This is, of course, impossible for us puny mortals to comprehend. Everything that happens to us is created by ourselves. Our consciousness creates our reality, whether good, bad or ugly. Our material world with all its suffering is a mass hallucination. We should all learn and evolve.<br /><br />Since everything is an illusion suspended in a timeless Now (pun intended), it's difficult to see the point of the exercise. How can you learn and evolve within an illusion where everything exists simultaneously? At various points in "Seth speaks", our friend tends to mellow his message somewhat. I have already pointed out that All That Is apparently evolves despite there not being any time, and it would seem that our existence in some sense isn't completely illusory, after all. As for suffering and evil, Seth concedes that suffering doesn't necessarily have to exist, that we suffer due to our unevolved state, and that the point of suffering is to teach us to overcome suffering - a somewhat softer view than that taken by, say, Dolores Cannon (see my previous review on this plane of existence). Still, when it comes to the philosophical points about time, space, matter and consciousness, I would say that a few books by David Ray Griffin might do Seth some good...<br /><br />Seth also says a few scandalous things about Jesus. Is anyone surprised? Apparently, Jesus was part of a broader personality incarnating as three distinct human beings: John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul. In 2075, Paul will return. This is tantamount to the Second Coming. Seth is unsure about the crucifixion. At one point, he seems to be suggesting that the entire Gospel stories are dramas and dreams, "real" on a psychic level but not in any material-historical sense. At another point, he spins a scenario similar to the Muslim one, only more weird. (Of course, the Muslim traditionsabout Jesus are in themselves warped versions of the Gnostic "laughing saviour".) Apparently, Jesus got away. Judas deliberately "betrayed" the wrong man to the authorities, a poor deluded crackpot who thought he was the Christ and absolutely wanted to be crucified. In drugged condition, this substitute was indeed executed by the Romans. His body was stolen by some of the disciples in the dead of night (hence the empty tomb). The real Jesus then appeared to the disciples, who therefore believed he had been resurrected. In reality, he was still alive and well in his physical body. Ah, what evangelical heresy-hunters could do with this!<br /><br />Does Seth really exist? At one point, our ghostwriter comes close to conceding that he doesn't: "This voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage". A similarity to other channelled material is the amount of historical references which makes no sense. Seth believes in Atlantis. He expounds at length on an underground civilization called Lumania, whose inhabitants were so fearful and shy that they made up the fierce warrior god Jehovah as a protector. Seth claims to have been a certain 4th century pope, but no such pope is recorded by history. More damningly, Seth claims that a Muslim Arab he once met wavered between faith in Allah and faith in Moses - an absurd proposition. Presumably, Seth or Ruburt have mixed up Allah with Muhammad! But even that is absurd, since Muslims recognize Moses as a prophet. Somebody should send Seth a book by Huston Smith on comparative religion, c/o Lumania.<br /><br />Part of my own multi-dimensional personage wants to believe that Seth is a real being and even help him find that poor dog of his (probably a Newfie). The other part feels that Seth is simply a part of Jane Roberts' earthly personality. He doesn't say anything that's *really* out of the ordinary compared to what every other Theosophist, kabbalist or esotericist has already said - except those parts that can be checked and disproved. But then, I suppose followers of Seth could claim that their beloved entity really did get some things completely wrong. In contrast to many other purported spirit guides, Seth is strangely unassuming.<br /><br />Despite the humour, I can't say "Seth speaks" is an easy read. It's repetitive, long-winding and often really boring. But yes, it could be of some interest to scholars of comparative religion or new agey seekers. One sure wonders how the contemporary spiritual scene would have looked like, had more entities like Seth been channelled by the Neo-Theosophical faithful? Imagine a conversation between Seth and Osho!<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure how to rate "Seth speaks", but finally I decided to play it nice and give our dog-loving, beer-sipping and vaguely Islamophobic ghostwriter three and a half stars.

When I got my new version of the large screen fire I was dismayed to find the elimination of the hdmi out on it.  this meant that I could no longer plug my Kindle Fire into my tv to see my books and more important my magazines on my large screen tv.  When my old tv went out and I got this one I did not know fully what I was getting.  I got a lot more than I bargained for which is a good thing.<br />I still need to use my apple tv to use airplay with my iPads, and mac computers but this tv works great with the android based Kindle.<br /><br />For me this is why I bought it, will keep it and am enjoying it.<br /><br />1. Picture quality is great.  clear distinct action and colors.<br />2. simple to program and change settings.<br />3. Very thin and light weight.<br />4. Nice stand if you do not want to mount it.<br />5. Not bad in the sound department.  You will want to try out the various modes but at setting 25 it is VERY loud and has good stereo etc.......<br />6. Plugged a long ethernet cable into it and now I have full internet speed.  did not try the wireless since I was within 15 feet of my apple airport extreme.<br />7. the provided functions...... over the air hd now looks like I have cable.

10699	__label2__	3	N	Camera	B00AR95FPO	Sony HDR-PJ380/B High Definition Handycam Camcorder with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Teeny Tiny Mess	The Sony HDR-PJ380 is a miniscule, light weight video camera with a built in projector that frustrates me. On the bright side, the video quality is good, the zoom range is impressive (from really wide angle to stalker telephoto) and the recorded sound is excellent. On the dim side, the camera is an ergonomic mess, the projector is weak, the lens quality is sad.<br /><br />December 6, 2014 Update: In the two years I have owned this camera, it has proven to be exactly what I thought from the beginning. I used the projector maybe 4 times and that was just to make people laugh. It is frankly a worthless attachment on the camera. The clip to hold the battery in has broken. That attachment point is a really cheap piece of plastic. The only reason I continued to use the camera is the wide angle lens. I used to shoot volleyball matches in tight areas. The wide angle was a major benefit. This camera is a teeny tiny mess.<br /><br />This is one of those video cameras that seem like a great idea; include a pico projector so people can watch videos right away, no television needed. In practice, it doesn't work out quite that well. The projector is really dim, the room has to be pretty darn dark to see the video and it has to be projected onto a white wall. The sound from the camera is just barely useful (I still can't find the volume control). This camera is capable of really good HD video, projected the video looks sad.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this camera is the ergonomics, how does this thing feel in my hand and how easy is it to use. I could never find a way to grip the camera with my right hand so that I could work the record button and the zoom button. My hand was always twisted around in an uncomfortable position and I couldn't hold the camera steady. Using my left hand on the screen wasn't a whole lot of help either. I do have big hands. The strap cannot be removed. I could get it to just barely fit my hand.<br /><br />There is this ridiculous USB cable built into the camera with no way to remove that useless piece of computer connection. The thing is poked into a slot in the camera grip. Personally, this is just extra weight to carry around. The pigtail is short, plugging into a laptop might work, but forget a desktop computer. The box does include a USB extension cord (but hey, I have to carry that around to use the camera, why not just make the cable detachable like every other camera manufacturer).<br /><br />The camera has a power switch located behind the flip out touchscreen, which has to be the single dumbest place to put a power button. When the video screen is flipped open, the camera turns on. In order to use the power button, the video screen has to be flipped open - turning on the camera. The other two buttons behind the video screen are a play button which switches the camera into playback mode and back to shooting mode; and a projector button that turns the projector off and on. Once the projector is on, the touchscreen no longer works. Menus and video selection has to be done with the Zoom lever and the photo button. This was a combination that I couldn't master, it was almost impossible to use. The even worst part of this whole mess - whatever memory was selected in the Setup menu, is the memory used for playback and projection. What a pain in the rear to switch between the internal memory and an SD card.<br /><br />Along with the three oddly placed buttons, there is a miniHDMI input and output port. The box contains a miniHDMI to standard HDMI cable. There is also a 3.5mm jack for a microphone or &#34;plug in power&#34; (whatever that means).<br /><br />There is a tiny flip door on the side of the camera for some kind of multifunction connector (no cable was included for that) and the AC adapter to charge the camera. The bottom of the camera has a trap door at the rear for an SD card and the tripod socket is in the center of the camera. If a tripod quick change plate is mounted on this camera, it is highly likely that the SD slot will be covered. Oddly, the battery release can be moved from either underneath the camera or from the side behind the video screen door. This is another mixed blessing - if I have the camera mounted on a tripod, I can open up the video door, turning on the camera, and then slide the battery release to remove the battery, turning off the camera.<br /><br />The disaster is that all the buttons on the camera are virtual; meaning everything to control this camera is on the touchscreen. That would be OK if there was some logic to the menus and buttons on the screen. This is the biggest mess of menus I have ever seen. The menus are: Shooting Mode, Camera/Mic, Image Quality/Size, Playback Function, Edit/Copy, and Setup. The Setup submenu is about 50 selections all in some odd groupings that are accessed by scrolling down (not swiping like in an iPhone, but touching an arrow to make the menu roll down one page). Finding the settings I need is the most frustrating complicated thing I have ever seen.<br /><br />The lens on this camera is not good. Outside chromatic aberration was bad (this is blue fringing around white objects against a dark background). The 55X end of the video is so soft, it is just barely useable. I have a sense that there is some kind of digital enhancement for the far end of the telephoto because the image goes very soft. Oddly, there is a setting to go even further with digital zoom (I had this setting turned off, and the video was still horribly soft). The worst part of this lens is the coating, there just doesn't appear to be any multilayer anti-reflection coating on the lens. I have never seen so much front element flare in my life. I was shooting in a room with fairly bright lights overhead; depending on where I stood the image was completely washed out with flare. From the exact same spot, my iPhone didn't have that problem.<br /><br />The only good thing about this lens is the wide angle. It is one of the widest lenses I have ever seen. I shoot volleyball matches and this is perfect to get the full court into the shot.<br /><br />Still images are just fine outside. Indoors in low light, image noise is a huge problem - the pictures are extremely grainy. I would say they are just slightly worse than an iPhone in the same situation.<br /><br />The video quality is good. I have a Canon HD video camera (Vixia HFM400) and the video looks pretty similar between these two. Image stabilization is surprisingly good on this camera. It does filter out hand shakiness surprisingly well.<br /><br />The recorded audio is absolutely outstanding. This blew me away, with all the other problems with this camera; I didn't expect the sound to be that good. I recorded a friend's rock concert - I'm pretty certain the audio was up in the 100db range, it was loud. The camera managed to attenuate that sound and record it perfectly. That's a feat not many cameras can accomplish. As usual, the microphone picks up sound all around, so noise will be picked up from everywhere.<br /><br />There are some decent features that took me a while to figure out and find. I do like the focus follow feature; touching the screen on the thing you want to maintain in focus will then follow that thing around the screen keeping it in nearly perfect focus. The battery seems to have a fairly long life. The camera does weigh nothing at all - it is teeny tiny (shoot the AC adapter is almost bigger and heavier than the camera).<br /><br />The camera is very particular about SD cards. I tried an ez Share 16GB class 10 card, the camera got all finicky about recording to it. The first three minute clip recorded fine, but then the camera went into an impossible to leave circle of trying to recover images and files from the card. I eventually went back to the internal memory. The first clip was recorded correctly.<br /><br />Transferring movies to a computer is a living nightmare. For some unknown reason the computer can only see thememory that was selected for recording. So if I need to transfer movies from both the internal memory and an SD card, I have to connect the camera twice messing with that stupid setup menu to select recording media. It is a stupid waste of time. The video and still images are included in a single folder. This connects at USB 2 speeds - meaning it takes forever to transfer HD movies.<br /><br />I didn't mess with any Sony software for this camera. There was no disc included in the box, only a website to go download software. In fact there was no description of what software I could get there or why I might need it.<br /><br />There is a lot that I dislike about this camera. For the price, there are much better cameras with better ergonomics, better lenses, and easier to use. On the other hand, I haven't seen a camera with as wide a lens, and none of the others have a projector. If for some reason you absolutely have to have a projector on your camera, well this is the camera for you. When it comes down to it, this is more like a $250 camcorder that had a projector bolted on for an additional $150.
10700	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B008NM6VSC	Crescent DB18X 18-Inch Indexing Flat Pry bar, Red/Black	A perfect demo tool	I confess...if I had to pick a favorite part of a home project, it would have to be demo.  There's just something...satisfying about knocking down something that's bugged you enough to want to renovate it.  It speaks to that prehistoric reptilian portion of our brains.<br /><br />This is a very good tool, not just for general demo but for uses where a crowbar would be too big.  First check:  it's heavy and sturdy, which is something that a good breaker bar/demo tool should be.  It's solid and substantial.<br /><br />Second check: it has a good handle.  The handle is important, not just for giving you a good grip, but for absorbing vibrations when you go to town on something.  Indeed, the head has a nice flat spot that doubles as a, ahem, &#34;percussive tool&#34; to slam the heck out of things.  And it works.<br /><br />Third check: it's versatile.  By that I mean it has an adjustable head.  This means if you need to pry something at an odd angle, you can adjust the head and get a 90 degree angle from the handle and whatever you're prying.  This makes life a LOT easier.<br /><br />In sum, this is the archetypal demo tool, easy to use and built to last.  I love it.

10702	__label2__	5	Y	Baby	B0040HIQSW	Itzy Ritzy Travel Happens Sealed Wet Bag, Urban Jungle Blue (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	My favorite wetbag-holds in smells and wet diapers	Hands down best wetbag on the market.  I took this with me on vacation since my oldest is highly allergic to disposable diapers.  I typically use and wash the diapers every few days.  However on vacation I didn't have access to a washer.  For 5 days I piled diapers into the 3 Itzy Ritzy bags I have.  We threw them in the back of our Durango thinking surly the smell on the way home would be horrible.  They never leaked and one ended up upside down and the smell never leaked out.  Now the smell when I did open it was nasty but I expected that.  The only downside to this bag is it wont hold as many diapers as some of the competitors.

Thick tubing is ok, but it comes bent so liquid doesn't flow thru bent areas.<br />Hard to suck liquid, but eazy to pump out.<br /><br />Refilling transmission fluid was much labor intensive and had spills allover.<br /><br />Will not recommend this for any automotive use, unless dealing with large quantities of liquid such as Semi Trucks or a Train perhaps ?

I live in a very rural part of Wyoming and the winters aren't the best for grocery trips to town to buy one or two items. I like the 2 packs. the sticks in the bag I opened I vacuum sealed in mason jars they look pretty on  my shelf as well as being quite comforting. I ground a few sticks for pumpkin pies, placed a few sticks on the back burner to scent the house. The sticks I ground to use in my fresh pumpkin pies, breads and muffins were very fragrant. They were spicy and warm. My house smelled good and with 2 enormous dogs, two horses in the yard and surrounded by chickens and cows, that's a very good thing.
10707	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B0014FTN6W	Black Diamond Powder Basket	Very functional - easy to put on/take off	I love the design of these baskets and how they go on and off - they are secure. Other designs required tools and contortions to change. One note - if you are getting these AND Black Diamond trekking poles at the same time - make sure the poles don't come WITH these already, else you will have a spare set.
10708	__label2__	5	N	Pet Products	B007CW2C46	Pet Gear Designer 4-Step with Removable Cover, Pet Stairs, Chocolate	Steps for your dog and cat that are tall and are easier to clean	This one is bed-size even for a tall bed, but too tall for the couch. I've had a few over the years but this is by far the best.<br /><br />Here are the reasons:<br /><br />!. The wooden ones that fold don't hold up.  With the weight being put on them, or them getting knocked over at times, those kind usually wear out in a year.  This one has no folding parts and when you put it together, it can't come apart, It holds sturdy.<br /><br />2. It comes with a washable cover. This makes it not only look prettier, but these things get coated in fur.  No need for them to stay that way now.  One quick wash and you are good.<br /><br />3. The carpeted top makes the stairs easy for even a little dog to learn to go up and down and keep their footing, but with no grooves that trap fur and make it hard to vacuum up.<br /><br />4. Taller height for even a really tall bed.<br /><br />5. Attractive as far as these steps go.<br /><br />Instant learning...happy to have it.  Easy to put together.

10713	__label2__	5	Y	Grocery	B001PQREKM	McCormick Ground Cinnamon, 18 oz.	Gardening aid which works! yes, for gardening	I have to admit that I did not buy this to eat or cook with.<br />I've been starting seedlings for years, but this year got damping off (died) of most of the young seedlings. So I searched for a safe product to use to kill the mold or fungus, whatever it is that attacks young seedling plants. I had used a chemical, actually 2 different chemicals, both labeled for damping off, but to no avail.<br /><br />So I wanted something different.<br />I had soaked and scrubbed everything in bleach, soap, hot water overnight, and some pots were NEW. I used only specified starter soil, from a tightly sealed NEW bag. Yet, all except 1 tomato plant had survived...we're talking about 2 dozen pots of different veggies and flowers!<br /><br />Cinnamon was recommended...yes good ole ground cinnamon, along with the other precautions, obviously.<br />Well, I must say that IT WORKS! Cinnamon can prevent damping off in seedlings. I knew I needed a lot to sprinkle on, and scratch into the top layer of soil, so I came to Amazon looking for a big bottle. LOL<br /><br />Bottom line: I have 2 pots of healthy little seedlings, with 2nd set of leaves, growing under lights. They smell great...like a cinnamon cake. :)
10714	__label2__	4	Y	Health & Personal Care	B005MFIR5S	Huggies OverNites Diapers, Size 4, Big Pack, 60 Count	Almost 12 hours	Our daughter doesn't quite sleep as long as she should. An average 10 hour night is fine in these diapers. I would say 12 hours is a stretch. She has peed through them, but overall they are a miracle compared to standard daytime diapers.
10715	__label2__	4	N	Electronics	B007B5WHTE	Philips CSS2123B/F7 Soundbar with Subwoofer (Black)	Decent for the price.	I bought this along with a similar model, the HTL7180, for the same $99 price. I wanted to compare. The CSS sounds much better. The sound is smoother. The bass is fuller. The dialogue is clearer. The remote seems better. And overall, the CSS is a big improvement over the older HTL, which is still for sale, but apparently discontinued. I returned that one to Walmart.<br />I have the CSS hooked up to a new model 32 inch Vizio smart TV with built-in apps. It's a master bedroom application. I think I will keep this unit since it performs well enough. It sounds better on music actually, than as a movie soundbar. Its simulated surround sounds sounds better than the HTL also. That one sounded like too much reverb. I wouldn't turn this unit up much past 30% unless your ears are oblivious to distortion.<br />The remote has adjustments for bass and treble, but they are minimal. This improves on the sounds of the TV speakers, obviously. A bonus is that its not too tall so it doesn't interfere with the TV infrared remote.<br />I have a feeling  the whole TV soundbar craze is going to disappear soon as TV makers figure out ways to make tvs sound better without all this extra junk cluttering up rooms. Soundbars will probably go the way of VHS players and Sony Walkmen in due time. But until then, this $99 unit serves the purpose adequately.

10717	__label2__	4	Y	Electronics	B00140DBRY	Sony SRF-M37W Walkman Digital Tuning Weather/FM/AM Stereo Radio (Black)	Decent piece of equipment	I had previously written a bad review for this radio, citing weak antenna performance. My bad. I took the radio out walking with me and it works fine, and it picks up a lot of AM and FM stations. I guess the reception inside my house is bad for some reason, but out in the open this radio performs very well. Sound is a bit tinny, but that's to be expected for such a small radio and at such a low price. I'm glad I bought it. It does what I wanted it to do: allow me to pick up NPR and the local classical music station when I'm doing my daily walk.  As a bonus, I can also pick up the CBS AM station (740, KCBS) in San Francisco, which is a great source of Bay Area traffic and weather information, updated every 10 minutes.
10718	__label2__	5	N	Pet Products	B00QHC02EY	AmazonBasics Waterproof Car Bench Seat Cover for Pets	Useful and worth it for peace of mind	We like this car seat cover a lot. Our use case isn't very demanding -- we have a small car (Toyota Yaris) and a small dog (Jack Russell). Pet hair isn't much of a problem because his are thick little white hairs that are easy to remove with a lint roller, but it is nice having a cover over the seats to act as a barrier for wetness and dirt. The cover also doubles as a tarp for hiding boxes and items left in the back seat or hatch when we leave them in the car for storage or moving. When it gets dirty, it can be unfastened and scrubbed/hosed down.  Useful and affordable, it's a small price to pay to keep your seats clean(er).
10719	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00MLPXPD6	Bakol Jel Dessert, Strawberry, 3 Ounce (Pack of 12)	cleaner alternative to Jello.  Not as firm or brightly colored, but SO much better for you!	We stopped eating Jello years ago, because of the toxic dyes, fake flavoring and other crap ingredients.  I (ok, my daughter) spotted this Bakol Jel Strawberry dessert in the grocery store last week (about $3.50 a package) and was very happy to see this cleaner, non gmo version.  It's made with 100% natural ingredients, non gmo, gluten free, and certified vegan.  It is not as vibrant as usual Jello, but so what.  It's so much better for you, so try to deal with it.  We tried making the Jel in our old Jello molds, and it actually came out ok, not as firm as jello but it still held its shape.  However, it is more watery, so when making it, I decrease the water it calls for a bit.  Also, if you let the set Jel warm to room temperature, it becomes very runny.  The taste is good though, very strawberry, but not in the intense, fake and artificial way.  If you are expecting something exactly like Jello, you will be disappointed.  If you have been searching for a cleaner alternative to jello, give this Bakol Jel a chance. We are happy to have found it, because the kids can finally have (occasionally) their gelatin dessert. The ingredients are: evaporated cane juice, vegetable gum, citric acid, potassium citrate, natural flavor, beet powder. I apologize for taking a picture of it on an orange plate, it's hard to see the color (which is a pale pink).  The Jel had been completely devoured by the kids before I could correct my mistake!

Progresso Light New England Clam Chowder is amazingly good. The flavor and consistency seem like a full-fat soup, and I confess that New England clam chowder is one of my guilty pleasures that I have fought to avoid for years!<br /><br />Amazon's price is pretty good, and with free delivery it is great. This is just what you want to stock up on for cold weather. It's actually so filling, that for me, it is a meal in itself. Highly recommended.

It works well but you need something like a fine tip permanent marker to write on it.  Luckily I have plenty of these.  I tear off a piece of the appropriate size, stick it to the counter, write on it, then peel it off and put it on the dry container lid.  Much better than using sticky notes which don't stick well in the freezer.

I thought it was a bit early for the letters/numbers situation, so I found these. She LOVES popping up to the fridge and finding different animals, making their sounds, and arranging them as she sees fit.<br /><br />The magnet covers the entire back of the animal so they stick easily and firmly, but aren't difficult for my kid to take off the fridge.<br /><br />And if you don't want to keep the barnyard on your fridge all the time, the wooden box they come in is great for storage!<br /><br />LOVE this set!

The first one lasted four years and needed its drum replaced as well as other parts.  We discovered that the price of replacing those items was almost as high as purchasing a new printer, so we opted for the new printer.<br /><br />We use this printer for our small business which involves printing color front pages which show the completed the project so it was important to us to have a printer which could do the work well and stay true to tones.  We found that the Lexmark was the best option.  We don't use it heavily so we were disappointed when it work out after four years but it is still the best one available for our needs and price point.

The luminous part of the hand is at the tip, and this did not help much. The quality seemed good, and I do have another type of momentum. I cannot really give more that 2 stars because the purpose of a watch is to clearly see the time, and I could not with this model. It is a very poor design and the hands should be much more pronounced.

She has dehydrated all kinds of vegetables, cooked then dehydrated pinto beans (home made re-fried beans are now a snap), she even made some beef jerky.

Then I remembered how terrible I was at golf, and kept losing them.  So, now I only use second hand Callaways.  Which has been great - I like the brand and not everyone uses them.  Or so I thought.  People I have been playing with ALSO use Callaway balls, and since mine are all different, I never know what # was on my ball, or what exact kind of Callaway it was.  I'd been looking for a nice way to mark my balls, without being too obnoxious.  I didn't want to scrawl my initials on there, or draw a line, or a picture of a whale or what-not.  That's how I decided on this gadget.  I can use it to cleanly and neatly mark my initials on a ball.<br />The contraptions works like this:  It's a blue shell that fits over the golf ball. There's a clear section which fits inside between the ball and the cover.  There's another part of the blue cover that you screw on to the underside of the ball.  The ball fits snugly inside, and you can rotate the clear inner ring to get to the letter or number you need.  It rotates fairly cleanly: it sort of "clicks" with each rotation, so that it holds relatively steady when you are trying to fill in your letter or number.<br />-<br />It's not the best device:<br />- It's hard to screw the bottom thing on.  You really have to press and turn to get it to fit correctly, and many times, mine wasn't all the way on, or the ball would move as I was trying to do this and so it would mess up where I wanted to put my initials.<br />- The inner ring is steady, but not great.  It can move around a little while trying to shade in a character.  It's really not all that bad, but you do have to be careful.  I hold the device so that my hand presses down on the inner ring as well to hold it steady.<br />--<br />It does work OK:<br />- The included pen works well, and it dries quickly and doesn't smudge.<br />- It's stable enough so that I can get my intials on there fairly decently.<br />----<br />The blue shell also has a line on it if you need to draw a line on your ball - some people do that for alignment I guess.<br />I do recommend this device.  I am happy with the results, and it's certainly priced right!!!
10734	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B007IJKQRS	Gone	GONE AND QUICKLY FORGOTTEN	GONE is a by the numbers thriller that offers an interesting premise but unfortunately left me disappointed.<br />No matter how cute Amanda Seyfried may be, I've never felt she had the maturity to carry a movie (MAMMA MIA, IN TIME, LITTLE RED RIDING HOOD), and of course she has most of the screen time in GONE.  The real problem is the script makes her do reckless and often stupid things that are pretty unbelievable.  A good supporting cast is basically wasted in roles that serve only as people for Seyfried to "bounce off of."  This includes Daniel Sunjata, DEXTER's Jennifer Carpenter, Wes Bentley, Nick Searcy, Joel David Moore and Michael Pare.<br />The film also has no twist ending, concluding rather flat.<br />A more imaginative script may have distinguished the movie but GONE is easily forgotten.

10737	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B007HT7HH6	1000ct Live Crickets, Large Size Crickets	Great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins...	These crickets are great for supplemental feeding of Purple Martins during times when they are unable to feed on flying insects due to inclement weather (temperatures below 40 degrees, excessive rain, wind or fog, periods of excessive heat and drought). Crickets are similar to grasshoppers which are a natural part of a Martin's diet.<br /><br />When the crickets arrive, place the box in the freezer overnight. Once frozen, open the box and separate numbers of them into multiple zip lock bags. This way you can take them out of the freezer one bag full at a time and allow them to thaw and reach room temperature for feeding to your Martins. When you open the shoebox size box you will find the crickets within several layers of cardboard egg crate material. The best and least messy way to remove the crickets is to lay several sheets of newspaper on a non-carpeted floor (if available) and shake the contents of the egg crate material and the box onto it. Then when you are done sorting and bagging the crickets you can simply fold up and discard of the newspaper and with it the cricket "debris" (food remains and feces).<br /><br />Martins must be trained to accept the crickets as food, so you need to wait until such time as they are unable to feed on flying insects and are hungry before attempting supplemental feeding for the first time. Then you can use a plastic spoon to flip crickets into the air for your Martins to "catch" by putting a cricket in the bowl of the spoon and holding the handle of the spoon with your dominant hand while using the index finger of your other hand to pull back on the top/tip of the bowl of the spoon slightly bending the spoon and flicking/flipping the cricket straight up and airborne near enough and within the Martins eyesight. If the Martins are perched on their housing, flip the crickets up near them so that they can see them. If they begin to fly keep flipping crickets when they are near and especially when they are flying lower to the ground. The first time I tried this the Martins had been suffering through a week of constantly cold, rainy weather in which no insects were moving. At first only two of my Martins flew to "catch" the crickets I sent airborne, but on the 3rd day of attempted supplemental feeding, the rest of the Martins were just so hungry that as they watched the two Martins that were flying and "catching" the crickets they eventually gave in to their hunger and joined in, too.<br /><br />If you plan on trying to feed Martins that are already too weak to fly you can try placing some crickets in their gourds or housing.<br /><br />Crickets, mealworms and pieces of cooked beef heart can be offered on raised feeding platforms, too. These platforms can be purchased from the Purple Martin Conservation Association (purplemartin.org) which is a non-profit organization dedicated to the conservation of Purple Martins.<br /><br />If your Martins are already used to accepting crushed egg shells or [[ASIN:B00AOJOBSE crushed oyster shells]] from a platform, they will more quickly accept supplemental feeding from platforms. Martins readily eat egg shells and crushed oyster shells and also feed them to their young as a source of grit and calcium. Extra calcium is extremely important for female Martins to produce strong eggs, and also for growing babies. A Martin's normal diet has plenty of protein, but they must get calcium in other ways. They will collect pieces of clam shell, fish bones, mussels, and snail shells from nearby lakes, rivers, ponds and creeks on their own, but can conserve precious energy spent in search of them when provided crushed eggs shells or crushed oyster shells. Just remember that chicken egg shells must be rinsed in cold water and then baked in a 200 degree oven for 10 minutes to kill bacteria such as salmonella before crushing them.<br /><br />NOTE: Many Martin landlords feed their birds scrambled eggs and while this may be okay in a pinch to feed to adult birds in inclementweather when their normal diet of flying insects is not available, scrambled eggs have high fat content and should not be fed regularly. Scrambled eggs are also not recommended for nestlings. Long term use of scrambled eggs will cause loose stool/diarrhea due to the high fat content. Cooked beef heart can be offered as a substitute to or alongside of mealworms and crickets, but ONLY BEEF and not pork.<br /><br />Also, mealworms and crickets can be sprinkled with calcium (in the form of crushed and powdered Calcium 600mg w/D tablets) before feeding to Martins in order to give them the calcium they need in their diet.

10743	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00LH1WWDE	Melissa & Doug Kangaroo and Joey Plush	Big and beautiful	This kangaroo is big and beautiful.  Initially, I was afraid my daughters would be be a little bit scared of it's size (about 3 feet), but they loved her.  They called her Kanga and Roo from the cast of  Winnie the Pooh.  It's sturdy and stiff that it  can stand on it's own, but it's soft enough to be huggable.  The small kangaroo is adorable and something that the kids could take with them to bed.  It fits perfectly in the pouch and stays there while my daughter moves the big mommy kangaroo around.  The fur is smooth and so far no shedding has occurred.  If I am to be critical and look for a negative thing about it, it is that the face is a bit expressionless, some stuffed toys have a 'happy' face, I can't really say that for this one.  With that being said, this is still a well made toy and looks it would last years.  If your child is an animal lover this is definitely a great addition to their collection.

The gameplay is standard for most TPS or FPS style but unlike most of the other shooter games this is a game of cat and mouse where you have can't take on a battalion of soldiers but ducking and firing so much as finding a hard to spot area and taking out your enemy from a distance then moving to another area before the enemy finds your location pretty much like a sniper.<br /><br />The controls for the most part are also pretty straight forward nothing to fancy or hard to learn with a little Splinter Cell esque effect put into play,meaning when you take out a an enemy that the other enemies if they see where your shot came from the game will show a ghostly white after image of where the enemy saw you.  The only complaint I have about the game is the lack of proper usage for the gamepad as it's pretty much just used as a controller without the use of the touchpad screen.
10749	__label2__	4	N	Home Entertainment	B00AYB3OMG	Panasonic DMP-BDT230 Smart Wi-Fi 3D Blu-Ray Player (2013 Model)	Nice Panny Product!	The Panasonic BDT-230 is my second Blu-Ray player. My first was a problematic LG BP530.  I have been a longtime fan of Panasonic products.  I have had good results with them and found them to be very reliable.  The BDT-230 appears to be no exception.<br /><br />Out of the box, this product comes with:<br />* The Blu Ray player, of course.<br />* Remote control.<br />* Two AA batteries for the remote.<br />* AC power cord.<br /><br />Since this is a product that uses firmware, I would recommend that the fist thing you do upon setting it up is to check for software updates.  So, power it up, connect it to your network, and let it check for updates.  If there are any updates, you will get a `New firmware is available' message.  The steps to update firmware are:<br />Press `Home' on the remote.  There is also a Home icon displayed on your TV screen.<br />Press `OK' to enter `Setup'<br />Select `Player Settings/System/Firmware Update'.  Respond OK to any prompts.<br /><br />The unit is just under 17" wide, about 1 ½" tall, and just over 7" deep.  It weighs 3 pounds.  The top right has, from left to right, the Open/close button, Stop, Start, and the Power/Standby buttons.  The front panel has the disc tray, remote control sensor, a flip down panel which reveals a SD and USB port, and the main display.  The rear panel has the AC cord port, HDMI port, Ethernet jack, and an optical (digital audio) port.<br /><br />I had no problem connecting the player to my wireless network, following the typical steps, providing my security passcode, etc.  The player sits about 50 feet from my router.<br /><br />The player is compatible with Android, versions 4.2 or higher/Mira certified.  I do not have an Android phone.  But a couple of my friends do, and I had them connect while at my house.  They had no issues.  I also had no problems with response for other DLNA devices, such as my Windows 7 laptop.  Response was fast.  I know a lot of people have complained in this aspect.  As with any response problem involving a network, the network must always be considered.  If you have an older (slower) or problematic network or broadband service, you will probably see issues on this device too.<br /><br />I am running FIOS at 50MBps down/25MBps up, but was at 35/35 when I installed the BDT-230.  I have the standard FIOS Actiontec `G' router, but I use an 802.11N router in front of it, so my thru-put between wireless devices is `N' (for devices that "handshake" at that speed).<br /><br />Again, I also upgraded the Panasonic firmware right out of the box, so that probably addressed a couple of fixes.<br /><br />As far as general performance, the player yields a great picture off Blu Ray, just like pretty much any other Blu Ray player.  I still have a lot of DVDs.  I found these rendered very nicely from the player onto my 50" Panasonic TV.<br />I am familiar with Viera as my TV has it as well.  I found navigating it and using it fine, and just as responsive as my TV.  I use it for Amazon Prime and Netflix.<br /><br />I know some reviews complain about advertisements.  There is an ad option on the player.  It is off on mine, but can be turned on.  I left it off, of course!<br /><br />I really like the player and overall I would order it again.<br /><br />There are two things I don't like about it.<br />1.  The HDMI is the ONLY physical AV jack, so you cannot hook this up to any TV, etc. lacking an HDMI port.<br />2. It does not play DVD-Ram media.  These do not play, even if finalized.  I actually have some DVD RAM, including many family videos I transferred from VHS eons ago.  Panasonic, who made DVD-Ram a staple of their product line, should not have products on which DVD-Ram cannot be played.<br /><br />These two things keep me from rating the player a `5', which it is in all other respects.

10754	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B006ZV6Y8A	Luci Mie Traditrici	Delightfully innovative opera, but this DVD release is flawed	The Italian composer Salvatore Sciarrino is both steeped in tradition and deeply avant-garde at the same time. Inspired by the classical canon, he nonetheless transforms that inheritance through extended techniques: strings play ghostly harmonics, wind performers overblow notes or produce multiphonics. Take, for example, his &#34;Sei Capricci&#34; for violin (1976, best heard on [[ASIN:B000GLKKT4 Coviello disc]]) where what looks like conventional Paganini-like writing in the score sounds when performed as sparkling, ethereal sounds.<br /><br />His 1998 opera &#34;Luci mie traditrici&#34; (My Treacherous Eyes, sometimes retitled &#34;Killing Flower&#34;) applies that style to vocal writing with remarkable effect. The simple plot is inspired by the story of Gesualdo, the Renaissance composer who discovered that his wife was cheating on him, and then murdered her and her lover in bed, his aristocratic rank protecting him from prosecution. Hearing that Alfred Schnittke was preparing an opera on the same theme, Sciarrino deleted overt references to Gesualdo (and quotations of Gesualdo's music), and he chose to adapt 17th-century playwright Giacinto Andrea Cicognini's own retelling of Gesualdo under the title &#34;Il tradimento per l'onore&#34;.<br /><br />As the opera opens, a Dutchess (soprano, here Nina Tarandek) and Duke (baritone, Christian Miedl) pledge eternal love to each other. Soon, however, the Dutchess is seduced by a Guest (counter-tenor, Roland Schneider), and the tryst is reported to the Duke by a Servant (tenor, Simon Bode). Thus ends the first act. In the second, the Duke prepares the murder of the Guest and then his wife, at which this hour-long staging comes to a sudden end.<br /><br />The vocal writing is eerie, lines thrown out scattershot, long-held notes at the beginning collapsing into a series of grace notes. The ensemble of 22 players (winds, strings and bass drum) produces Sciarrino's characteristic soundworld of skittering, noctural sounds. While avant-garde, the musical accompaniment is not noisy or abstract, instead it seems to depict the unspoken thoughts of the characters. As a prologue to the opera, we hear a snippet of pure Renaissance-era music, and later in the opera this same material is heard transformed through Sciarrino's extended techniques. The action is stylized, with for example the Dutchess and Guest's tryst expressed only through repetition of suggestive lines and pregnant pauses. The austere and ritualistic proceedings remind this viewer of drama from some non-Western culture, such as kabuki.<br /><br />In this DVD, Marco Angius leads the Ensemble Algoritmo in a July 2010 production. How does this stack up against other recordings? This seems to be the same performance as captured on a 2011 [[ASIN:B0050JPFMO Stradivarius disc]]. There is an [[ASIN:B00013D4OK earlier Stradivarius disc]] where the Ensemble Risognanze performs, but I have not heard that yet. I am familiar with the Klangforum Wien/Beat Furrer performance [[ASIN:B00005JSJH on Kairos]], and that is somewhat superior in terms of sound (the ensemble being more prominent in the mix). However, the Algoritmo/Angius production is deftly performed and Sciarrino himself calls it definitive.<br /><br />While its nice to have at least some visuals, I am not entirely happy with this DVD. It's bad enough that this was released solely in DVD instead of Blu-ray, but even the DVD transfer is flawed: with artifacts visible in near every shot. Was this shot for television broadcast and then re-encoded for DVD? The DVD does come with a bonus where the singers, Angius and the Ensemble Algoritmo rehearsing the piece and discuss how they approach Scarrino's music.<br /><br />So while I would consider &#34;Luci mie traditrici&#34; a four-star affair (impressive, though not among the greatest operas I've ever seen), that poor quality of the visuals leads me to dock a star. I'm sorry I have to do that, since I suppose we should be grateful we get avideo of this avant-garde opera at all.

10759	__label2__	5	N	Video Games	B002BSA20M	Halo Reach	The Best Shooter	Halo Reach is up there with Modern Warfare 2 and Battlefield 3 as the best shooter of the xbox 360 generation.<br /><br />This is simply an incredible game. The graphics are grittier. The gameplay is tighter. Gone is the too-obvious auto-aim in Halo 3. The Flood does not exist at all. The Elites are not superfriends, but are a vicious enemy.<br /><br />There is more the reality that the SPARTAN soldiers are really distrusted by many humans.<br /><br />Where Halo 3 felt like an xbox 1 game with some next-gen graphic features tacked on, Halo Reach truly feels next-gen. The lighting is better, everything is crisper, it is simply a superior game.<br /><br />What makes this game great for me is that it is sci-fi, and yet it feels so real. The SPARTAN soldiers are otherworldly, yet some of the early game locales feel like isolated farming hamlets not too different from Earth. Early on, I got the sense that the SPARTAN team was reminiscent of Latin American death squads, which at least is somewhat more realistic of groups of men with guns who maraud across the countryside. If you know anything about the game's fiction, if not for the Covenant invasion, that is pretty much what the SPARTAN soldiers would have been: fascist stormtroopers taking out high-value targets of the human opposition, because the lumbering government refused to negotiate.<br /><br />But then the Covenant arrive and that gives them the opportunity to unite against a common enemy and be heroes.<br /><br />Because this is, after all, a video game.<br /><br />Still, I appreciated that early part. I really like this game.

You can select from only 4 settings:<br />- High for 4 hours<br />- High for 6 hours<br />- Low for 8 hours<br />- Low for 10 hours<br /><br />That doesn't do me much good when I need to cook a recipe on Low for 4 hours.  I will have to be home at the end of the four hours to manually turn it off or switch to warm.<br /><br />I wish I had discovered this before I put food in it.  I would've taken it right back to the store, and ordered a REAL programmable slow cooker from Amazon.  Now I'm stuck with it.  :-(
10761	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B001AD8FT4	Man From Cheyenne	Rounding Up Rustlers	The Man From Cheyenne, 1942 film<br /><br />Cattle graze, men on horses ride up and shoot their pistols to drive them into a cave. "About two hundred." They are placed on trucks and driven away. The "Wyoming Cattlemens Association" hold a meeting on this theft. An alarm sounds outside, there is a robbery. A man shoots at the fleeing automobile. "Nice shooting." The man from the Department of Commerce has a job for him. Roy grew up in that area and would not be suspicious. Cowboys sing as they ride, they meet Roy. Roy meets Judy next. Gabby complains about cattle thefts. There is a meeting of the ranch owners. They want to pool resources and coordinate their activities. One horse threw a shoe. Gabby rides with Roy and Judy.<br /><br />Miriam gives a party on Saturday night. There is music and dancing. [There is comedy.] Then a song. The rustlers struck again! Where did they go? Jim caught one of them, he's one of Miriam's crew. They will take care of Jim and get rid of his horse too. The next morning they notice Jim's absence. When his body is found Roy finds sand in one boot. [Trace evidence.] Roy finds that hidden cave, and Bob finds him. A shot misses them! Roy rides after the shooter and captures him. "He's one of the Hardy men." But Roy is seen near that tunnel! Roy talks to Miriam about the rustlers. He tests her and she fails! The shooting begins, Roy is trapped in the ranch house. Help arrives just in time. Judy and Miriam struggle. Will Roy stay or move on? And so it ends. [No mention of the trials and sentencing.]<br /><br />This is an interesting story about rustling done at one of the cattle ranches. Did this reflect war-time fears about a "fifth column"? My copy had low contrast washed-out video. Some of these movies were cut back to 53 minutes to fit into an hour of TV with advertising.

Seeing  that I have 4 kids with no respect for cars (they just don't understand yet) I definitely need help protecting the seats in my car. So when I was offered  these Kick Mats from Kiddleco for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I definitely ordered a set! They arrived and I immediately put them on the seats in my car. They were so easy to put on and I can already see marks on them from where the kids kick them with their dirty feet! The nice part it being able to wipe them off with just a simple damp rag! I definitely recommend these Kick Mats from Kiddleco for anyone who has kids!
10763	__label2__	5	N	Books	1612183123	Trail of Dead (Scarlett Bernard)	Great Characters, Excellent Story	Trail of Dead is the second Scarlett Bernard Novel.  I read and reviewed the first novel, Dead Spots, in October of 2012.<br /><br />Sometimes a second book is a let down.  That is not true of Trail of Dead.  If anything it is even better that Dead Spots.  One of the things that struck me this time was how two different authors can take the same premise and write books that are completely different.  In the Alexia Tarabotti novels by Gail Carriger Alexia can negate supernatural powers or when near vampires and werewolves they become normal humans.  Scarlett does the same but the stories and characters are completely different.  The fact that it took me two books to even make the comparison is proof of that.<br /><br />The world building was done in Dead Spots.  The main characters are the same. Jesse, Scarlett and Eli are all part of the story but the focus has moved from Jesse and Eli to Scarlett.  Trail of Dead builds from the foundation laid in Dead Spots.  Again the writing is excellent, the plot well developed, the characters well drawn and tension builds to a satisfying conclusion.  Again, there were some unexpected twists and turns.  This book was based on a problem character from book one.  That character is now gone.  Trail of Dead could be the last Scarlett Bernard Novel but I am hoping that I saw a small set up for the next book.  I will certainly be on the look out and hoping that the series will continue.<br /><br />Trail of Dead is scheduled for publication June 4, 2013.  I received an advanced reader's copy review copy of Trail of Dead from Amazon Vine.  You should pre-order your copy now.
10764	__label2__	4	N	Beauty	B00BRGUNV2	Nexcare Acne Absorbing Cover, Two Sizes, 36 Count	Good results	My son works in a fast food restaurant and as a result his acne breakouts are epic. NEXCARE ACNE COVERS resolve the problem like nothing else we've tried. When applied properly in two days the pimple is gone, the covers though do have to be reapplied and at times with the amount of breakouts he has I'm still not sure if this is the ultimate solution as we'd be going through many boxes per week.<br />Having a clean and DRY face for the application process is a must otherwise the covers don't stick. When they do they work well on whiteheads and blind pimples not blackheads.<br />Recommended.

This is made for &#34;bigger&#34; TVs and bigger rooms.  Therefore, make sure you have the space for it before purchasing.  We've previously had Samsung and another Vizio sound bars (either sold or broken), but this one is so above and beyond those ones.  It's a bit pricier than the shorter models, so make sure you can justify your purchase before diving in.
10766	__label2__	3	N	Toys	B00CI6J3QG	Crayola Dry Erase Light-Up Board	It Is Okay	First, you must know, my kids are artists. They like high end art supplies. They draw, color, sculpt, and create all the time. This is just added novelty to their already artful day.<br /><br />Now, the batteries (3 AA, not included) are almost impossible to put in. It was a great circus act to see my husband try to get them all in their proper place and get the cover back on before they sprung in different directions. It took him an embarrassing amount of tries to get them in properly. They just want to pop straight back out.<br /><br />The black/white board and the top clear plastic board slide in and out of the frame. [[ASIN:B00CI6JDGQ Crayola Widescreen Light Designer]] does not do that, it has a fixed board, which is preferred. Yes, the slide out boards give you the option of white or black background, but the white is extremely difficult to see.<br /><br />This board comes with dry erase crayons. If you've ever worked with those, you know they leave a waxy residue on the board. You'll need to clean that off after their daily use. Not between every drawing, but before they put it away for the day. I recommend washing it in dish soap- it cuts the waxy build up quickly and easily. These crayons are also ridiculously messy. They write on skin. They smear off onto skin. They are difficult to remove from the cloth of your tan sofa. (Doh!) Just be aware of that and plan play accordingly.<br /><br />This board comes with a wipe off cloth. Unlike other reviewers, my children had no problem using the cloth. It was pretty easy for them. I do have to wash the plastic board when they're done so that they can happily play the next day. But they can clean between drawings effectively.<br /><br />This one does not look as good as [[ASIN:B00CI6JDGQ Crayola Widescreen Light Designer]]. The drawings do glow, but they aren't as sharp as the widescreen version. They clear plate over the black one with the open frame just doesn't hold the light quite the same. If you're torn between the two, buy the widescreen. It is much better overall.
10767	__label2__	3	N	Beauty	B00AE078YM	Clear 7 Day Intensive Treatment Tubes, Color and Damage Repair, 3.5 Fl Oz	Some improvement	I was actually surprised to see some results at the very end of this treatment.  I don't wash my hair every day so I used these tubes for 7 consecutive washes.  I didn't notice much difference during the first 5 tubes, in fact, my hair felt heavy and with some residue.  My hair is wavy but med/thin and it weighs down easily.  By the 6th and 7th tubes, I notice my hair was a bit bouncier and the frizz control had improved.  I didn't see a dramatic change, like super silky or shiny, but I did notice the almost no frizz - and we have had rainy days, so I know it helped.<br /><br />My hair is brown with some highlights.  This treatment didn't make the highlights dull or fade away (like other heavy treatments have done).  I didn't use a special shampoo, just used this treatment instead of conditioner (with longer waiting time).  I didn't use any other styling products either.  Each tube has plenty of `cream' and I wonder if a person with short hair would be able to use half the tube at a time.  My hair is about 3" below my shoulders now, and I could've used 2/3 of the tube and have plenty.<br /><br />Overall, the 7 'day' treatment improved my hair but didn't change it dramatically.

I'd even be happy with red.<br /><br />The stitching is thick and the canvas material I'm assuming, has a fairly big play in protecting. This fit my Sony with no problems. It has room for my iPad, but I haven't used the bag for that.<br /><br />There are plenty of compartments for someone who likes to be organized. The bonus is the warranty, my laptop won't even make it that long.<br /><br />This is a solid product!

These are a lot bigger than I thought they would be!  I got these as a novelty gift for a friend and they're perfect.  The plastic around the lip isn't sharp either so you can use them to drink out of easily.  They'll hold ten ounces of liquid if you don't fill them to the tippy-top brim.  We hand wash all our glasses so I don't know how machine safe they are, but they seem to be made of a sturdy plastic.  Also the upper cup piece is solid so there's no risk of liquid leaking out the bottom at all.
10776	__label2__	3	Y	Camera	B0072B5CNU	Panasonic HC-V10K HD 70x Optical Zoom SD Camcorder (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	For the price, a good buy!	I purchased this digital video camera as a backup for surveillance investigations primarily for the 70x1 optical zoom.  I have had good success with Panasonic video cameras in the past though primarily rely on a Sony Handycam HDR-CX160 these days which is more than twice the price with a 40x1 zoom.  This camera is a great value but it is very, very lightweight and not overly rugged so this would be for a mature or experienced user as it isn’t as sturdy as many in its class and isn’t going to take being knocked around.  However, it will slip in your pocket without you hardly noticing it’s there.  That being said, it operates well, the zoom is great though you will need a mini-tripod or monopod to keep your long distance subject in focus.

10778	__label2__	5	Y	Kitchen	B00BP3ZQZ0	Linden Sweden Jam Funnel	Handy, Affordable Funnel for Kitchen	*****  I really do like this jam funnel. I don't use it for jam.    It is pretty sturdy for a plastic funnel. The top diameter measures just under 5 inches. The funnel is 1 1/4 (1 and 2/8) inches across on the inside, and about 1 5/8 on the outside. So this means that the plastic thickness adds 3/8 inches to whatever it fits INTO.    I was tired of funnels that get so skinny at the end. I have a hard time getting powder through those. And the ultra-wide canning funnels don't fit into the jars I have because they are too big. So this funnel is incredibly handy--kind of an in-between compromise between a regular funnel and a canning funnel.    Recommended, nice product!  *****

A friend recommended using a reusable sleeve so I gave this one a try.  Love it!  I actually didn't really care what it looked like, as long as it did it's job - it does, so I am a happy customer.  Fast shipping, and no weird smell that sometimes comes from items like this.  If I had more than one coffee cup like this I would buy more.

I got this because I could not move my leg post total knee replacement surgery.  I was better off with a top sheet wrapped around the foot.  I felt more like I was lassoing a wild bronco than moving my leg off the bed.  It wobbled which made my knee move wrong.  Hurt like heck.  This may be ok if you want to move your leg onto a wheelchair from the floor, but not good for getting a &#34;dead wood&#34; leg out of bed.

They've also held up well over time - no problems with the towel bar pulling away from the wall.  I especially love the quality of the finish.  I agree with the earlier reviewer that the price seems like a lot, but having checked out more affordable towel bars the finish always seems to look cheaper and more fake.  This collection, for me, just adds to my updated bathroom and makes the entire room look more polished.  Love it.

If you love baseball, or statistics & math & gambling type of thinking, then you will love this movie.  It also has a lot of heart & is a true story of a great manager & team.  I love Oakland A's & SF Giants Bruce Bochy. I want more movies about great managers like Bruce Bochy & Billy Bean.  Oh, & Brad Pitt does a great job of playing his character.<br />This is a great movie to own on the collection shelf & is very unique from any other managing style or movie. I LOVE this movie!!

I bought this to use at my remote hunting cabin and it worked perfectly.  The water does take some time to heat up but it does warm up nicely.  I purchased one of those propane hose adapters so I could use a 20 lb propane tank instead of the small propane cylinders, but the small cylinders do work, just not sure how many uses you'd get from the small cylinders.  After heating the water I followed the directions and pumped up the tank to build internal pressure.  Once this was done the shower head/hose supplied an excellent flow ofwater with which to shower with.  This thing worked fantastic, I love it.  It's very nicely built, fits nicely into it's carrying case when not in use and functions fantastic.  Great item, I would definitely recommend this item.

They also fit my other cooker base perfectly, and i already have lids that fit, though anyone without the usual excess of lids can grab some at Goodwill or on Amazon. Though the newer nonsticks are stronger than the old kind, I still plan to use my bamboo and silicone utensils to make them last. I shouldn't ever need to replace these.

My wife loves her Keurig, and loves to use her own coffee so I thought this would be perfect for her. Well, boy was I wrong. First, I should note that our Keurig came with an adapter that she uses to make her coffee using the grounds she likes. This saves money, is more environmentally kind and yields a better cup of coffee! Using the Melitta Javajig yielded a weak, ground filled cup of coffee. Since you still have clean up/rinsing afterwards, you don't even save time. This is what she uses: http://www.amazon.com/Keurig-Replacement-Coffee-Filter-pieces/dp/B009VIUI04/ref=pd_sbs_k_2 and she is very happy, as I mentioned, it came with the unit we bought (a couple of years ago). There is no need to waste money, paper, etc.! For my wife to tell me to give it one star says a lot, folks.

For my money, its the best on the market. That said, the stock they're selling here is very poor.<br /><br />I ordered a few different sizes and both orders had issues. When I got the first order, I immediately noticed the manufacturers box had water damage and was ripped apart. As a result, the cans basically fell out in transit and were rolling around in the Amazon box. All were heavily dented and some had rust on them for some reason.<br /><br />As for the second order, the cans and box were in better shape (still some dents), but the expiration date was just 2 weeks away. I have to say, I really ate that I got practically expired products.<br /><br />In the end, I was very disappointed with both orders and wont order Blue Monkey via Amazon any longer.

This can hold most of a &#34;head&#34; of green leaf lettuce. That's the only type of lettuce we eat, so I don't know how much it will hold of Iceberg. I would say that this could provide enough lettuce for four good size salads. Maybe more. I love this thing. Definitely recommend it!!!!!!!

My first born had colic and he rarely slept during the day and at night he wanted to be propped up.  He did not like to lay flat ever.  I read about this product and decided to give it a try it was perfect.  I didn't have to put him on his stomach or put a wedge in his crib which made me nervous.  This allowed me to put him on his back and be tilted.  I was able to put this next to my bed so I could rock him gently back to sleep after feedings.  Its light and folds so its easy to move from room to room.  My second child thankfully did not have colic but this worked great b/c he always wanted me in his sight so I could move this around and it kept him off the floor and away from his big brother.
10797	__label2__	5	Y	Toys	B0084M8UE4	Survive Escape From Atlantis 30th Anniversary Edition	A great family game (especially for aggressive players) that will bring the smiles to kids' faces!	This is a great family game to play, as long as you don't have any sore losers in your family or gaming group. This game is half offense and half defense. As long as everyone is just out for themselves, this game is a lot of fun. If one person is ganged up on or if "teams" are formed, things can get a little ugly.<br /><br />The premise of the game is already described pretty well in the publisher's product description, so I won't go into that any further. What I will say is that the game can be taught to play in about two minutes, and anyone aged 5 or older will be able to play it without any trouble. This game has a fun theme and is very light in terms of concepts and rules, making it an easy entry-level game for anyone who isn't accustomed to "designer" games. Play time for the game is around 30 minutes if four people are playing, but shorter is fewer are playing. If you want to expand the game's number of players to five or six, there is an expansion available ([[ASIN:B005FPEWCC Survive 5-6 Player expansion]]) that must be purchased separately. This game was out of print for quite a long time but is finally available, again, along with a few mini-expansions, including [[ASIN:B004LE0W1S Survive: Escape From Atlantis - The Giant Squid Mini-Expansion]] and [[ASIN:B00CA2B0V4 Survive: Dolphins and Dive Dice Mini-Expansion]]. I have no idea how long this print run will be available, so it may be a good idea to purchase this while you can get it!<br /><br />Survive is a fun little game that most any kids or adults will enjoy playing, and they will probably want to play it more than once - especially if the scores are close! I highly recommend this to all families!

10801	__label2__	3	N	Kitchen	B001CUMLOK	ZeroWater ZD-013 8-Cup Pitcher	Don't buy this one unless you're one of two categories	I wasn't sure what I thought about Zero Water, but I have been a Brita and Pur user for years. I'm always interested in trying different water filtration technologies and seeing how they taste. Conclusions with this one:<br /><br />1.  It does produce water that tests as no particles / dissolved solids<br />2.  It doesn't filter out some things that the other two big brands do. Certain bacteria, cryposporidium, etc. This is declared on the package insert.<br />3.  The water it produces may feel better, but may or may not taste better.<br /><br />It clearly changes the water. The filter itself is about 2-3 times the size/volume of a Pur or Brita. The water feels more wet in my mouth. I like this. What I don't like is that the water it produces for me doesn't taste as good as what I get out of Pur (which is what I'm currently using). I do like the feel better, and it makes more clear ice cubes, so I am going to (gulp) use them together. First the PUR, then this one.<br /><br />And now for why you shouldn't buy this one unless you're one of two people.  This pitcher is poorly designed. The lid barely stays on and doesn't lip down over the edges to prevent spills when the top filler area has water in it-- for example, refilling to the line and taking it back to the fridge.  The flip lip that opens when you pour is terribly thin. The edges of the plastic were sharp and not polished. The only positive about this pitcher is that the handle is designed very sturdily. That being said, if you need an 8 cup instead of 10 because you absolutely can't fit a 10 cup, this model might be for you.<br /><br />The other person who might want this one is someone who doesn't care about the tester. This one has an analog result tester: Light on means bad results, light off means good results. Or the device might just not be testing at all.... I didn't like that. The model that does 10 cups, and comes with the digital tester is only $2 more!<br /><br />If you have enough space for the 10cup, and you'd prefer a digital tester rather than a cheap analog one, go for the 10 cup model.

10805	__label2__	3	N	Sports	B0066Q4GSO	Callaway Hex Chrome White Golf Ball, 12-Pack	No better than similarly priced balls; in fact worse in some ways	I only golf 2-3 times a year, when I visit my father in Pinehurst.  My Dad, though, plays almost daily, so I brought these 3 balls with me on my last visit, and we both gave them a try.<br /><br />For me, I couldn't see any difference between these Callaways and the Callaways my father regularly uses (hex black).  I'm not very good no matter what ball I'm playing with!  But my father felt that the hex chromes were tooo soft; they are supposed to have a 'soft feel' but these, he says, are more mushy.<br /><br />Bottom Line: A mediocre golfer's game is not improved with the hex chrome, a strong golfer may find them too soft.  My father did point out that a golfer with more experience than I have (who is therefore more discerning), but who has a weaker swing than he does (maybe a woman golfer) might enjoy these balls.

10809	__label2__	5	N	Office Products	B00FX51LA0	Wilson Jones Ultra Duty Round Ring View Binder with Extra Durable Hinge, 1.5 Inch, Customizable, White (W87905PP2)	Easy Open/Close and Secure Closure Rings	There are times that you have a binder that gets a lot of use. And there are times that a binder is just an organizational storage container. This is a great binder for heavy use and quick access. It does not have a super heavy duty cover, in fact I'm not sure it is much different than the basic binders. But the spine and rings are great. They are O-rings with a silicone covered single push tab that pops them open. They are double locked where they meet with a little pin that sinks inside the other side for added security. And the cover and spines allow for sheets to be slipped inside.<br /><br />This size is great for meeting notes, project organization, etc. and is easy to carry.<br /><br />The inside covers have deep, clear pockets for slipping a page or two but not much more. I think this is good as an ultra duty binder because it has such a great O-ring set-up. Easy open close and secure closure.

Well designed with all ports and connections easily accessible.<br /><br />Weight : 17.2 oz (1.075 lbs) slightly heavier than the iPad Air itself.<br /><br />Keyboard: Very thin and keys are designed to type faster. Some keys are oddly placed like &#34;/&#34; has to be used with shift, &#34;:&#34; is next to the space bar, and back arrow is placed close to pair button. I guess this will take some time to get used to.<br /><br />Smart function: Entirely missing. It does not automatically sleeps and wake your iPad. You have to do it manually.<br /><br />IPad Enlsosure: The interior side to hold iPad is a bit flimsy and not good quality as expected from the overall product. Its held by mere elastic bands.<br /><br />Exterior Surface: Good looks, can be wiped clean easily.<br /><br />Positions: Three standing positions in horizontal orientation. The keyboard cover can be fully folded into the back for reading in vertical orientation. However, it is a bit convenient due to more than twice the weight from iPad Air itself and hence not suited for long time reading.<br /><br />Overall, it is a good companion for typing and writing and may provide good value for money at about 50 bucks.

However, the decision to make this an RPG was pretty stupid. To "level up" you have to perform stupid exercises, and then distribute stat points. IT's more RPG than Mass Effect 2.   OTherwise, yes it is an interesting take, but it seriously should have been more an arcade game.

This is a good designed tool that is manufactured in China. I really like the spring on the pliers. You will hate the pouch. Always hangs up. If you can only have one tool would I recommend this over a Leatherman? No it's not the Leatherman made in USA quality. Leatherman and Gerber both have outstanding warranties, you will be more likely to need the Gerbers in my experience.<br />This tool feels good in your hand, and it's the best Gerber multi tool ever. My older Gerber multi tool got so loose and then when I pulled it from the pouch after not using for awhile had serious rust and I just shook my head and trashed it. Their newer tools are much better thankfully, but that looseness possibility still concerns me. The one thing to check in comparing tools side by side is the machining of the Phillips head screwdrivers. In that attention to detail regard Leatherman and Sog still better the Gerber.

10814	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B0009PUR72	Coleman 12 Ounce Enamelware Coffee Mug (Blue)	Great Old Time Mug	I have owned a number of these Coleman mugs for years. In fact I have one that is over 12 years old that went on every hike I ventured on over those dozen years.  (It has since been retied and enjoying the good life on a shelf).  These mugs are not the kind that will appeal to everyone for sure.  You have to have a real nostalgia thing going to enjoy it them, or just like the feel of it over an open fire on a cold morning or evening.  Sure the handle gets hot if the coffee is really steaming, but it dissipates quickly if used outdoors where it has always been in service with me.  The number of times I have used it at home over the fire place the hot handle has never bothered me since I don't get the coffee as hot as over a campfire.<br /><br />As to some of the other more critical reviews of this about it chipping and peeling, I think one of the fallacies about old time enamel mugs like these is that they are prit' near indestructible which is not true.  Just because they are made of metal you can't toss them on a pile of rocks or expose them to all manner of rough weather.  I've always treated mine like they are made of out glass and done just fine with them.  No doubt some of the reviewers here that had their mugs peel and whatnot were as careful as I am and still saw their mugs fail or fall apart way too fast.  All I can tell you is that the number I have owned have held up well for me and I have never had a problem with them.  Altogether a rugged, well made old time mug at a good price that I highly recommend... : )

10817	__label2__	5	N	Baby	B00HAZSBIG	Munchkin Bath Fun Bubble Blower Toy	Redesign seems to have done the trick...	My toy arrived and I admit I had some frustration getting it out of the packaging, this little bird was tied in TIGHT.  I'm glad I didn't alert my little one that it had arrived because he would have had to wait a LONG time for me to first get the thing out of the packaging and then try to get the battery cover off to get the batteries in.    Once I had achieved that herculean task though, operation couldn't have been more smooth.  There's a little button for off and on at the top of birdies' head and that's all it takes for him to start up the fun after you add the bubble solution.  You can use any type of bubble solution you like undiluted.    I found that this does actually seem to be best for the tub or barring that, outdoors because of the wetness factor.  I personally would NEVER use this indoors except in the tub.  It does tend to get wet underneath and around the unit, so if that is going to be an issue just place it on top of a towel or something like that.  Really - I think that is why this is labeled as a "tub toy" primarily.    It works well and delights children.  I had no issues with the operation of it.  Especially boisterous youngsters may accidentally knock this over if using this outside without aid of the suction cup.... so supervision might be in order.    EDIT 2-17-15 Still working well on original set of batteries.   I do note that if you don't empty out the bubble stuff each time or run it out that it will leak out.   We have just taken to leaving this permanently in the bathroom tub on the ledge so it's not that big a deal but worth noting if you want to conserve your bubbles or think you might be returning to "use them later".   I also note that when we switched bubble brands to a cheaper one we can't use it continually for more than five minutes at a time.... we have to let the bird "rest" because the bubbles get too thick and sudzy and it can't spit them out as well.   So if we turn it off for a few minutes then turn it on again that seemsto do the trick.  We could go back to using the more expensive bubbles.... but since our system works and our 4 year old seems ok with our explanation of the bird needing to "rest" it doesn't seem to pressing to pay more money.

They are semi soft and quite crumbly. In fact most of the ones in my bag were broken. The dogs seemed to enjoy them and they suffered no ill effects. The bag is resealable which is convenient and helpful when transporting. It was hard to tell how many were in the bag since most were crumbled. They are free of corn, wheat, artificial flavors or preservatives.<br /><br />There were no guidelines for feeding other than to break into pieces for a small dog. I wasn't crazy to see that they contained both sugar (sucrose) and salt. Plus this company does not provide easily accessible information about where the ingredients are sourced. You will not find it on the website or the package. You must call Customer Service. They keep a list of the origins of the proteins but not all the ingredients. They will tell you that they do use supplements, mainly folic acid, from China.So while the dogs like them,  I will stick to treats made in sourced from the US like [[ASIN:B001FKC8W2 Stewart Beef Liver Freeze Dried (2oz)] or ones I make myself.

Given the high rating of this device on Amazon, I decided to give it a try so I could add Bluetooth capabilities to a mini-system that I keep in the kitchen.  Since buying it, I've been transporting it between other systems in the house.<br /><br />Audio quality seems to be pretty good--not as good as a direct connection, but this is all about convenience.  What really shines is its ability to easily pair with other devices.  I find this receiver with no problems using the Bluetooth built into my laptop.  But with my phone, all I need to do is tap the top of this device with my phone; the phone then enables its own Bluetooth connection, and pairs automatically.  (The magic of NFC, aka near-field communications.)<br /><br />With such easy pairing, and good sound quality, I can't rate this any less than five stars.  It has worked flawlessly for me in the time that I've owned it, and plan on buying at least two more of these in the near future.
10822	__label2__	4	N	Home	B00G00BTEA	McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System	Not my silver bullet for cleaning grout, but a really nice cleaner overall	[[VIDEOID:mo1NPCSAEORZPD5]]Over the past month, I've had the chance to audition the McCulloch [[ASIN:B00G00BTY0 MC1230 Handheld Steam Cleaner]], [[ASIN:B00G00BT72 MC1375 Canister Steam System]], and the [[ASIN:B00G00BTEA MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System]].  All of them come across to me as being well made, and none of them seem like they are overpriced.  Prior to trying these, I've owned a [[ASIN:B000I618NY Wagner 905]] for over four years.  The video shows the three McCulloch cleaners side by side, shows the included accessories, and discusses the individual cleaners a bit (sorry it's so long, but there's an outline at the front that shows when each segment is).<br /><br />I admit that I had high hopes about this model (and the slightly less expensive 1375) before they arrived because they are higher pressure cleaners than the Wagner.  I bought the Wagner to help clean grout in my new tile, but it never did a very good job with it.  I thought the added pressure might be the added boost that I needed.  To cut to the chase - it wasn't.  I might be using these wrong, but they just don't seem to get the grout any cleaner than a wet cloth does.  So, a disappointment for me on the grout, but I still recommend it if you're looking for a steam cleaner for the following reasons.<br /><br />Pros and why I like it:<br />(*) The steam mop attachment on this (and it's the same on the 1375) is fantastic!  Soooo much better and quieter than the one I've been using on the Wagner.  I think McCulloch did a great job with that.  I'm particularly aware of it because that all I really use the Wagner for anymore, and this model was just an overall better experience. I had stopped using the Wagner and had switched to a regular mop, but I believe that I'll switch back to steaming.  This and the 1385 are just so easy to use, and the tiles seem really clean afterwards<br />(*) The hole to pour water into is in a recessed area, so you don't have to use a funnel or have perfect aim to avoid a mess.  The shape of the opening serves as its own funnel.  I love that!  It's a big improvement over the Wagner model that I own<br />(*) Well made.  All of the accessories feel solid and fit well, and the main unit also seems solid<br />(*) Long power cord<br />(*) Long extension steam hose<br />(*) Really good set of included accessories, including a window squeegee and some extra spares not included with the 1375<br />(*) Fairly high pressure steam with an analog dial showing the pressure<br />(*) Comfortable handle and trigger<br />(*) Ability to adjust the steam flow with a dial right on the handle by the trigger<br />(*) Can wrap up the power cord like on a vacuum cleaner<br />(*) Extendable handle let's you easily roll it around like one of those roller carry-on luggage bags<br /><br />While it didn't help me with the specific problem (dirty grout) that I was hoping it would, it does a really nice job steam mopping my tile, and it's well made with a good set of accessories.  It's an enormous step up from the Wagner that I bought years ago, that's for sure.  This is the most expensive of the three McCullochs that I tried, and about twice as expensive as the Wagner that I've had for years, but I think it's the best value out of the lot.  The added convenience features, higher pressure steam, and good set of accessories put it at the top.  Recommended.

I saw discussions online about how packing cubes really help consolidate your items to make room for more stuff.  So I thought I'd try the Travelwise Cube System.  I just got back from a six-day trip, and I have to say that I am very favorably impressed with the quality and performance of these cubes.  I got waaay more into a carry-on size suitcase than I would have previously believed possible.  I just rolled my clothes, and put them into a cube, stacked in a row just like pencils in a box.  And surprisingly, this method did not result in the clothes coming out badly wrinkled.<br /><br />These cubes are extremely well-made.  The seams and the zippers appear to be quite strong, and the materials are high quality.<br /><br />Definitely recommended!<br /><br />(Bonus:  TSA can see exactly what's inside the cube, so your clothes don't get rummaged through during security checks.)

10828	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B00JSPCQXM	Pioneer SE-MX7-K Headphone, Matte Black	Combine very good audio quality and comfortable design	[[VIDEOID:mo154JOVRZUKSIM]]I was impressed with the comfort and audio quality of the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones. The ear cushions are supple and comfortable, even for wearing for extended periods. I acknowledge that I'm not a hardcore audiophile, but I've been listening to music since 78-rpm phonograph records were the primary media, so I do have some idea what good audio sounds like. I ran through one of my favorite playlists, and the music sounded as good or better than with any of the headphones that I've used. Vocals had excellent clarity, and the range of sound was very good with rich trebles and deep, but not overpowering, bass. One feature that I haven't seen on any headphones that I've used is the bass level control, a rotating dial on the left headphone. To my ears, it had a small but noticeable effect on the bass level, but my preference was to leave it in the default position.<br /><br />Two of the songs that I use to check out headphones and speakers are Annie Lennox's "Love Song For A Vampire" (listen for the heartbeat in the background) and The Surfaris' "Wipe Out" with drummer Ron Wilson's continuous drum riff. Both sounded great with the MX7 headphones. I also played a couple of stereo setup utilities ("Channel Balance Test" and "Stepped Stereo Pan Test"), and the headphones passed with flying colors.<br /><br />The headphones are very comfortable to wear for extended periods. I wore them for a hour on two occasions while evaluating them. The adjustable headbands allowed a good fit, and the thick ear cushions were comfortable. Both headbands will extend up to 1½", and the earcups will rotate about 15 degrees horizontally for the most comfortable fit.<br /><br />The headphone kit includes a 52" cable with an inline microphone (for using with a smartphone) and 3.5mm plugs. The plug that fits into the headphones has a rotating locking mechanism that ensures that the plug can't work loose, a very helpful feature. The headphones and cable fit nicely ina zippered soft case.<br /><br />In my opinion, the Pioneer SE-MX7-K headphones are premium-quality headphones that combine exceptional audio quality and comfortable design to give a very pleasurable listening experience.

10830	__label2__	4	Y	Luggage	B004EZG9X4	EatSmart Precision Voyager Digital Luggage Scale w/ 110 lb. Capacity & SmartGrip	Easy & Compact	Not long ago I flew off to the United Kingdom to spend several weeks with my daughter and granddaughter.  Before I left I spent weeks shopping for luggage, packing & repacking, checklists in hand.  And then I read the fine print on the luggage allowances . . . .<br /><br />It used to be that you could set the suitcase on the bathroom scale, but flat scales and wheels on the suitcase have done away with all that, so five days before I was due to catch the plane I realized that I had to do something to weigh the suitcases.  Going over your allowed number of pounds by even a single pound can be quite expensive.  This [[ASIN:B004EZG9X4 EatSmart Precision Voyager Digital Luggage Scale w/ 110 lb. Capacity & SmartGrip]] was the answer!<br /><br />This is easy as pie to use:  unhook the catch, wrap the straps around the handle of your suitcase, clip the strap shut, push the on button, wait until you see zeros and then lift the piece of luggage off the floor by the handle.  The weight displays in seconds.  Since you use two hands, I had no problem with my smaller carry-on.  I did have to corral my son-in-law to weigh the larger as I am too short to get the thing off the ground.  (I could probably pack myself in that suitcase without too much discomfort LOL.)<br /><br />The directions suggest that you underpack by a pound, then stash the scale in your suitcase.  I simply threw it in my pocketbook, where it took up only a minimal amount of space.  SO much easier than messing around with the bathroom scale trying to balance the suitcase!<br /><br />Recommended

The controls are pretty simple once you get to know them or have played the previous SC games,the effects,audio and story are top notch kudos to Ubi Soft for the great work.<br /><br />So for fans of the series here's a incredible new release and for those just getting started into the series I say if you can start from the first game or at least from the previous game to get a feel on the relationship. and story background of some of the characters.
10833	__label2__	4	Y	Books	1595231072	Unintimidated: A Governor's Story and a Nation's Challenge	Insights Into the Man and His Methods	I will first note that I think Scott Walker is a 5 star governor based on his record as of this review.  Having said that, this is a book review - not a review of Scott Walker - so I've downscaled it to 4 stars based on the book itself.  The book discusses the challenges and controversy of passage of Act 10 in Wisconsin, as well as many other reforms instituted by Walker and the Republican majority in response to a budget crisis in 2010.  The book lags and repeats in spots, but is generally well written and easily read.  His principles and approach are well documented, and his positions as well as prescriptions are well articulated at a macro-level.  The book coveys the palpable tension of the 2011 protests and their aftermath.  As Walker begins to contemplate a run for President in 2016, it is important to be informed - and this book will give you some insights into the man and his methods.

This Avery business card stock should be called instant business cards for that it was it truly is. With a few simple steps to set up your word processor file, you can quickly produce as many or as few professional appearing business cards. The page of cards sticks together firmly and goes through the printer (well, mine anyway) without any breaking or jamming. The color sticks as cleanly as it does for any paper. And then, once you have it all printed up, just break the cards out - they come out without any ugly tabs. And voila, you have a group of high quality business cards!<br /><br />It probably sounds like I am going a bit over the top, right? Well, in fact, just recently I needed some business cards, and I was able to create a batch with this product in a matter of minutes. I was very pleased with the results, and think that this product is tops. I give it my highest recommendations!
10835	__label2__	3	N	Home Improvement	B00UD413RC	Mudder Desk Lamp Led Book Reading Light with Eye Protection Flexible Neck and Clip on Dual Lights (White and Warm White) Dimmable Colors, Black	Not very bright, but has a nice switch and flex neck	[[VIDEOID:e69353dba5885c9c0230bbd179014b6f]]This us a clip light with 4 settings, the light it produces is not very bright.  I used a lux meter to help demonstrate the brightness of the light:    white light / bright setting = 344 lux  white light / low light setting = 162 lux    warm light / bright setting = 104 lux  warm light / low light setting = 66 lux    For comparison,  a 60 watt fluorescent light at the same distance is 1701 lux    The clip of this light is quite large, it is not something you would clip to the book as it would cover too much of the page. I found the clip a little stiff stiff and difficult to open, hopefully it will get easier as I use it.  I am using it clipped to a shelf.  My favorite feature is a nice switch on the cord that allows me to control the four light modes.  The neck is flexible and holds its position well.  It comes with a cord and USB adapter.    This clip light is provided by Mudder.    Ali Julia review

10837	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00GZFNHOA	Philips AVENT Breast Milk Storage Bags, 6 Ounce, 25 Count	Durable and easy top access	This is a very durable milk storage bag with easy top access. We use these bags when our milk bottles are full.<br /><br />It is easier to store than the bottles, though it meant having to pour it from the Medela bottle which my wife pumps directly into. The top of the bag is quite large so there is little spillage, and we store it in standing position.<br /><br />My wife usually breast feeds my girl so storage is not an issue though we feel that if you need to store more milk say in a freezer load, then these AVENT milk storage bags may not be as suitable due to its fairly large and bulky form.
10838	__label2__	4	N	Electronics	B00BXJZ30Y	iLuv Syren iPhone 6 NFC Compatible Bluetooth Portable Speaker (Black)	Not bad but rather overpriced	The good is that this pairs easily with most bt devices, and as a speakerphone it's quite adequate. It looks pretty nice, though this leads to...<br /><br />The not so good is that though this looks iSleek, that emphasis on looks over functionality made them stick the pause button for receiving calls on the back of the speaker. Since it's slanted, this is just silly in every way. Other negatives are that while this sounds ok for voice, for music it's merely fair, and that it's not the heavy duty construction you'd expect at this price.<br /><br />It's a decent little speaker-phone/speaker combo, but 50 is too much for this somewhat flimsy piece of plastic, however shiny. 25 to 30 is what this is really worth, I'd say. And that button on the back must give one pause, as it were, as to whether that feature will make the speakerphone aspect worth pursuing.<br /><br />Amazing how designers just don't really think things through, or place form over function so often.<br />In a world of cheap disposable crap, that crap should at least make perfect sense while it does indeed work.<br /><br />Bluetooth is still a selling point so companies are getting away with overpricing simple bt items. That can't last, nor should it.
10839	__label2__	4	N	Books	0803738552	Counting by 7s	A beautiful story - a no spoilers review	This is one of the most beautiful stories I've read in a long time. It's about a 12 year old girl named Willow who looks and acts different from typical girls her age. She's a genius but the quirks don't stop there. She gets joy out of counting by sevens and is obsessed with medical symptoms and diagnoses of diseases. After disaster strikes, Willow has to find a way to cope with the motley group of people she unexpectedly finds herself among.<br /><br />This book has all the making of a Newbery gold medalist: strong character development, a lovable and unique protagonist, a death (but it happens early so it's not a depressing book), well written prose and unexpected hilarious moments interspersed. I really enjoyed it and hope it gets at least some recognition by way of awards.<br /><br />That said, even though I think it's an excellent book, I am dubious that the target age group would enjoy it. The beginning is slow and, due to the early death, was hard to get into. There were days I didn't want to pick it up because I didn't want to read about grieving. Once I got past that, I was eager to open its pages. But I can't help but think that adolescents would not be as tenacious with their reading. Also, there aren't any heart-racing moments where the excitement peaks. This is a book to savor and to relish, not to grip with white knuckled fingers at 2am.<br /><br />But personally for me, an adult, I was enchanted by it and am glad to have read it.<br /><br />P.S I know I mentioned the death but since the product description mentions it, I didn't consider it a spoiler.

Seriously, I'm in love with this series too.<br /><br />If you like PLL, you're most likely going to be a fan of this series as well. SS is able to keep you guessing the whole time, and by the end of the book you only want more. I stumbled across this entirely by accident, and now I'm reading my way through the series. I won't post any spoilers, but it's different...yet the same as PLL. You're going to want to know who did it, but you won't be able to figure it out. The clues will keep you guessing, and the plot twists will make your heart race. You'll love some of the characters, then hate them... and then love them again. It's awesomely fun to read, and I can't wait to get the next one!

The Aluminum is machined well and it looks good.  I do have a little trouble getting the threaded pieces to start threading again after taking it apart and this could be better in another unit than mine. Stainless steel or Brass would be a better material than Aluminum.  It does have a pretty powerful Neodymium<br />Magnets for the inner piece, which allows it to come apart to load the grinder. It has diamond shaped teeth for grinding and a<br />Stainless Steel Pollen Screen and an Nylon &#34;O&#34; ring for whatever purpose it serves, I am not sure.

They work well for cleaning lightly soiled dishes, washing counters and stove tops.  I bleach my counters a couple of times per day, at the end of the day, because they're white, and while cooking, after opening a package of meat, to avoid cross-contamination.  Thus, I have to be careful to only use the white cloths on the counters, since the bleach discolors the black cloths.  Other than that (and that's due to my idiosyncracy), these cloths are good and durable.

10850	__label2__	1	N	Books	0761452915	Exiled: Memoirs of a Camel	a bit mature for children, and heavy on Islam indoctrination	I was torn on how to review this book. On one hand, the book is a page turner, but as a children's book (or at least children's reading level), it's hard not to be a page-turner... on the other hand, the references to the Q'uran and Allah were nearly on every single page. It was over the top. I do not have a problem with children being exposed to other cultures or other religions - but this was not exposure - this was non-stop praise for Allah. Each chapter opens with a quote from the Q'uran and nearly every page has either a person or a camel praising Allah. I don't know if it was put in there to try to add realism to the story, but it was so emphasized, it made itself way too obvious. It was a distraction to the story. I was interested in reading this book when I read the description because of the history of the US Camel Corps. I had never heard of this experiment in American history and was intrigued by the story. The camels were captured and sold in Egypt to the US government - so I get the names they used - many of which were the authentic names of actual camels and people involved in the Camel Corps. The camels bowing to pray to Allah was a bit much. Even without the non-stop indoctrination (seriously - nearly every page), the content was a bit intense for young readers. The book is listed as for grades 4-8. Even without addressing the all-Allah-all-the-time references, the subject matter seems to be beyond what I'd feel comfortable with even a 7th grader reading. Camels mating, camels killing each other, and the Egyptian cameleer anxious to go into town to get to the prostitutes. Seriously? I'm not sure what the editors were thinking and why they didn't rein some of this in. The story of the US Camel Corps is one that needs to be told - I just think there's a better way to tell this story to young children. When looking at the book as a whole - it's goal to tell the story to children, it fails as it is too mature and heavy on religious indoctrination - whether or not that was the intent of the author.
10851	__label2__	4	Y	Musical Instruments	B00CE0VLXO	Electro-Voice ZLX12P Two-Way Powered 12" Loudspeaker	A great utility speaker for live sound applications	I bought six of these plus an EV ZXA1 powered subwoofer and I am satisfied with my purchase so far. They've been used as a monitor rig for my much larger QSC KW system and also as a mini rig for small clubs where the speakers filled both main and monitor roles. The inboard DSP works really well to smooth out the peaks and clipping and it allows for perfect Xover free matching of subs and tops. I used a pair of these tops with a pair of QSC KW 181 subwoofers and it worked in that configuration as well. They are not exceptionally loud, but they will do small rooms pretty well and have no problem working as floor monitors. Along with one of the ZXA1 powered subwoofers I was able to fit six of these and a 12 channel mixer in a tiny Toyota Corolla for a gig at VA Beach. I even brought lights and stands and it all fit in there with no problems. I surprised some veteran musicians who at first judged my mini rig as underpowered from the looks alone, when I turned up the kick drum during soundcheck to reveal that this full range system does not lack low frequency extension (in fact the sub provided the kick drum thump we all know and love!). It really is a good sounding system that gives the venerable QSC K12 a run for the money. I hope to get many miles out of these speakers.
10852	__label2__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00NJTXW9A	Epson Home Cinema 3500 1080p 3D 3LCD Home Theater Projector	This projector is exactly what I was looking for!	I was so excited to find this projector. I've been wanting to do outdoor movies with my neighbors and this is perfect! It's so easy to setup, I can easily have an outdoor movie setup and ready to go in less than 1/2 an hour. Here's my take on this projector:    INSTALLATION  Installation is super easy. Just plug in the power cord and your video device cable. There are three different ways to connect this projector to your video device (HDMI, RCA, component).  The easiest and best is HDMI. There are no cables included, so I had to go out and buy and HDMI 25 foot cable and got what I wanted. This allows me to run it from either my cable box or computer super easy and the projector can be further away than just the standard short length HDMI included with my TV. With the HDMI it's a simple plug that includes both video and audio. You could run 2 HDMI cables since there's two ports in the back of the projector. I was able to hook this up with my Comcast Xfinity cable box super quick and had TV projected in my living room super-quick. Installation couldn't be easier!    DISPLAY QUALITY  Display quality is amazing!!! It is crisp, bright, and clear. It even displays beautifully in the daylight. I was totally amazed at how great the picture quality is. The color and clarity looks just like a regular flat-screen TV.    SOUND  There are built-in speakers and they're perfect for my needs. If you want to add external speakers you can, but totally not necessary for my outdoor use with small groups of people. The sound is very crisp and clear.    3D GLASSES  This couldn't be easier. I was able to try 3D using my Comcast Xfinity tripleplay 3D channel. It is included with my standard service, I just had to contact Comcast for them to "enter the code" so I could access channel 897. I charged the glasses before use for a couple hours and watched 3D for a little over an hour with no reduction in the battery power. All you do is turn on the power on the glasses, then hit the pairing button on the glasses and it paired right away with the projector with no problems. The 3D quality was great! Comcast has on demand 3D movies, so I can't wait to take advantage of that service since I don't have a 3D blueray player (although I'm considering getting one now). You must have a 3D player if you want to watch your own 3D movies.    PROJECTOR SCREENS  I wanted a portable screen and I finally found one at Fry's in Wilsonville, Oregon manufactured by Loch. [[ASIN:B00DV1INFY LOCH 84" diagonal 4:3 Tripod Projection Screen]] I tried Best Buy and was disappointed that they didn't have any screens "in store", the guy just wanted to sell me one from their on-line store. I didn't want to buy it on-line because the shipping is so expensive and I wanted to see the quality of the screen before I made the purchase. Fry's has the Loch screen in 100" and 83". I went with the 83" model and it is perfect for indoor and outdoor use. 100" [[ASIN:B00HK23QJI Matte White 100" diagonal Portable Projector Screen]] was too big for my little, tiny living room. I also considered the Epson portable screen [[ASIN:B000HRYV38 Epson Duet 80-Inch Dual Aspect Ratio Projection Screen]]. You can also project on the wall...I did in my computer room and it was so cool....read on...    COMPUTER HOOKUP  Just like the cable box, it was super easy to connect to my HP Envy laptop through the HDMI cable. The only problem I had was I had previously put it in 3D mode and didn't realize I had to take it out of 3D even after unplugging the projector. I can surf the web, watch YouTube videos, and show my huge library of photos on my wall. Even work on Word and Excel documents in super-large format...this is like having a HUGE COMPUTER MONITOR.    TECHNICAL SUPPORT  I had to call Epson tech support when I couldn't get my laptop display to show up. It's funny, their tech support looks like you're calling Long Beach California, but the tech support is actually routed through the Philippines. The technician spoke very good english, was courteous, and helpful.    SIZE AND CONSTRUCTION  It is fairly large (measuring approximately 15 x 12 x 6 inches) but worth the extra size over the tiny portable units since the quality is extraordinary! It has a big remote (measuring approximately 2.25 x 8.5 x 1 inch) with lots of buttons. What I really like is the remote has a "light" button that illuminates the buttons, so it's super easy to see and use.    OVERALL  Overall, I love this projector. It is exactly what I was looking for and I couldn't be happier with this product!

10858	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B005NQ5LSC	The Legend Is Born: Ip Man (Blu-ray/DVD Combo)	Legend is Born: Ip Man	Fans of Ip Man and Ip Man 2 are sure to find their way to this flick, which, if it had been made first would have gone down just fine as an average martial arts movie, but as it came in their shadow feels like a just passable direct-to-video sequel to a well-received blockbuster.<br /><br />I won't get into how much of the story must be pure fabrication for this "biographical" picture, but it serves well enough as a framework to insert action scenes. There is plenty of martial arts skill on display here too, so genre fans shouldn't be disappointed in that. However, a lot of it is simply sparring, or dealing with local bullies, and there's never really that adrenaline-pumping feeling that anything's really at stake for Ip Man.<br /><br />The story does try to insert the drama that will liven up the fight scenes, but it's all hammered into the final act without any build up or tension. However, if you do turn off your brain entirely, the action scenes are entertaining enough to keep Legend is Born from being an abomination, if not a memorable martial arts thrill ride.<br /><br />In the end, Legend is Born is entertaining enough for action fans. It has an interesting, if wildly fictional, story and is well-acted. It's a great movie for a lazy afternoon.

10860	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B00HDKJESO	Walking With Dinosaurs (Blu-ray 3D / DVD Combo Pack)	A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's "Dinosaur", "Land before time" and "March of the dinosaurs",	A FILM ONLY FOR CHILDREN, borrowing heavily from Disney's &#34;Dinosaur&#34;, &#34;Land before time&#34; and &#34;March of the dinosaurs&#34;,<br />Even if the title is the same this children oriented film has virtually NOTHING IN COMMON with the ground-breaking 1999 BBC series &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34;, as far from being a document, this is in fact a film for kids, in which dinosaurs and birds are intelligent and can talk. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.<br /><br />PARENTAL WARNING! Some scenes in this film can and will TERRIFY youngest children, especially in 3D (both in theaters and at home) - the scariest scenes include very large predators (there are numerous Gorgosaurus in this film) jumping towards the public and seemingly trying to gnaw at the spectators with their mouths (filled with scary looking teeth) wide open and violently snapping. I would rather avoid showing it to children below at least age of 7. There is also a pretty scary and impressive scene of HUGE RAGING FOREST FIRE and some terrified and crying for help pachyrhinosaurus DROWNING in a freezing lake...<br /><br />First, let's stress it again, in this film, like in Disney's 2000 film &#34;Dinosaur&#34; and like in &#34;Land before time&#34; series some dinosaurs (and one bird) are fully intelligent and can talk. Like in Disney's film, we begin with the main hero, a young pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi, being just a hatchling - and the runt of the litter... Patchi, his big bully of brother named Scowler and his other siblings speak, A LOT - on another hand for some reason their parents don't talk. At all.<br /><br />Patchi is very badly treated by his brothers and sisters, but he befriends a prehistoric bird named Alex, who plays with him and talks. A LOT! Later Patchi will meet Juniper, a little female pachyrhinosaurus of same age as him, who will become the love of his life. As you can see, the main dinosaurs here are fully &#34;humanized&#34; as in &#34;Dinosaur&#34;and &#34;Land before time&#34; and they will continue this way during all the film, even when they are fully grown up. On another hand other dinosaurs and other creatures (including some pesky cretaceous mammals) don't speak.<br /><br />This film borrows A LOT from Disney's &#34;Dinosaur&#34;, with Patchi being in many ways similar to Aladar, Juniper being a carbon copy of Neera and especially the character of Scowler being an almost identical twin to Kron. To continue the similarities, bird Alex simply replaces the lemurs and the pack of gorgosaurus takes the place of the pair of carnotaurus. The species are different, but the characters are not... Sorry, SPOILER here: even the final fight was copied from the final confrontation in &#34;Dinosaur&#34;...<br /><br />On another hand, this film is also in large part inspired by a good document called &#34;March of dinosaurs&#34; (see my review of this one) made in 2011 and narrated by Stephen Fry. Both this film and &#34;The March of the dinosaurs&#34; are centered around the yearly migration of a huge herd of dinosaurs living in Cretaceous in North America to the south in autumn and then back to the north in spring. In &#34;The March of the dinosaurs&#34; the main character was a young edmontosaurus called Scar because it was hurt in childhood and the pachyrhinosaurus are secondary characters - here the main hero is a pachyrhinosaurus called Patchi, who was hurt and scarred in childhood and the edmontosaurus are secondary characters... In both films we also meet some gorgosaurus, troodons and scavenging pterosaurs. I personally found &#34;The March of dinosaurs&#34;, which is a document trying to stick very closely to science, much much better and at least as interesting for older children and teenagers.<br /><br />My 12 years old daughter - who likes dinosaurs, monsters, aliens, mutants and anything else that goes nicely with popcorn - enjoyed this film, which contains some pretty humouristic moments, provided mostlyby wise-cracking bird Alex. Me on another hand, I was only partially satisfied, for following reasons:<br /><br />- the images are certainly gorgeous but ultimately not really better than in the &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34; which was after all made 14 years ago<br /><br />- the 3D is useful in a couple of sequences (I was really tempted to try to pat a quetzalcoatlus pterosaur on its beak...) but not really so much needed during the rest of the film.<br /><br />- the number of dinosaurs species shown is really rather limited for such a long film - only four species are really shown for any duration (pachyrhinosaurus, gorgosaurus, troodon, edmontosaurus) together with the quetzalcoatlus pterosaurs one bird and a couple of little mammals. There is also one ankylosaurus and a couple of chirostenotes, parksosaurus and hesperonychus all appearing like for 10 seconds... and that is all.<br /><br />- the film doesn't know really where to go. Most of time it is a film purely for children, but then by moments it tries to be also a document - and as a result it is not entirely succesful in either category.<br /><br />Bottom line, this is a watchable dinosaur film FOR OLDER CHILDREN and YOUNG TEENAGERS, but nothing else. For adults and older teenagers I really advise to skip it and watch/re-watch other great British dinosaur productions like the original &#34;Walking with dinosaurs&#34; series and &#34;The March of dinosaurs&#34; or the excellent American series &#34;Dinosaur revolution&#34;.

10862	__label2__	4	N	PC	B007X3VEUW	iHome   Fashion Folio Case for iPad 2 - Dots Navy (IH-IP1142DN)	Very basic cover that will do what it needs for the price.	This is a very very basic cover for the ipad. It's not going to take a beating for long and it's not going to last long if you try to beat it up.<br /><br />This is a case that will work well if you have a brief case or bag that you put your ipad in when not in use. It doesn't have a lot of the frills that other cases have though. The case itself is a bit thinner than most of the others that I've used and already I see that the corners are curling up a little. Also the fabric cover around the binding seems very thin and like it will wear through rather quick. I tend to slide my case around on the desk a lot and I see some areas that are already concerning me.<br /><br />Does it hold the ipad though, sure it does. It's not exactly a great fit but it's not a high priced cover either.<br /><br />I can easily see needing 2 of these a year but if you are nice to your case you should be able to get a good year out of it.
10863	__label2__	4	Y	Camera	B00508I2AC	Linco Flora 35 inch Hexogen Easy Softbox	Excellent quality of light but more fiddly than easy	I own a Linco Flora Fluorescent Light Bank. It's a wonderful light head but, if you want to use a softbox, the Linco Flora Hexogen Easy Softbox is the only one that fits it. Conversely, the Easy Softbox only fits the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank.  CONSTRUCTION: The Hexogen is a modified umbrella sans central shaft. It appears well made with heavy duty nylon fabric, reflective interior, steel ribs, plastic nylon hub and a velcro secured white diffusion panel/cloth. Compared to Neewer softboxes, it's heavy duty. Build is similar to LimoStudio softboxes, albeit twice as expensive. While the 35-inch hexagon shape makes nice catchlights, it’s bulky and can’t be rotated for a smaller profile like rectangular softboxes.  SETUP is easier than a standard softbox with component ribs but more fiddly than a umbrella softbox or Brolly box with central shaft. Begin by manually spreading the ribs open. Secure by pulling the string through the center hole until a latch locks in place in. To collapse, press the latch. It’s faster and less fiddly to simply push the hub with my palm until it locks. The pull string is its weakest element, albeit easy to replace if broken. Slow and gentle assembly is recommended and don't muscle or jerk that wee string.  Installation on the Flora Fluorescent Light Bank is fussy compared to a shoot through umbrella or umbrella softbox: align ribs with indentations on the Light Bank, compress hub until you feel a slight give and tighten front and rear thumb wheels. If you don't maintain compression during lockdown, the thumbwheel shaft will not bite into the hub. Setting up the Easy Softbox is marginally faster than a normal softbox. Maybe a minute saved? Nevertheless, it works wonderfully with the Flora Light Bank: pleasingly even and soft light with attractive catchlights. It also looks professional and clients are impressed!  MUSINGS: The Flora Light Bank and Hexogen Easy Softbox are available as a kit but are fifteen or twenty bucks cheaper whenpurchased ala carte. Oddly, neither the head or softbox ship with instructions or even a link to a PDF or video tutorial. Experienced studio shooters will figure out how to assemble and use these products in a couple minutes. After all, they’re similar to other CFL heads and umbrella softboxes. However, a beginner will have a tough time setting it up. The included storage bag is a cruel joke. An inch more in width and length would have made it much easier to fit the folded softbox. I keep the Hexogen in an old Vanguard tripod bag. Finally, unlike some other reviewers, the item I received was emblazon with the Linco Flora logo on both softbox and bag.  FINAL BURB: Improvements I'd like to see are a metal hub, stronger pull cord, larger storage bag and enclosed instructions. It’s pricy compared to my LimoStudio softboxes but the Hexogen Easy Softbox is a solid product: integrates well with the Flora Light Bank, boasts quality materials and construction and renders pleasingly soft light.

10866	__label2__	2	N	Furniture	B008P7T4LQ	South Shore Morgan Collection Storage Cabinet, Royal Cherry	Heavy, not real wood, chipped and scratched, looks fine...	Stay away from this product. Go to IKEA (much better quality) or any local store. Basically, you'll get a higher quality product at a lower price. I guess if you don't have an Ikea or a similar store anywhere near by...<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Color is a nice darker cherry/<br />- Marker included (more on this later)<br /><br />Neutral:<br />- Very heavy. At around 125 pounds, I was expecting it to have some solid wood pieces, mixed in with some laminate ones. However, it's all laminate, not one piece of it is made of real wood.<br />- Putting it together was cumbersome but relatively straight forward, you have to hammer in a few pieces (per the instructions) that on other similar products you typically screw in.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Every single one of the 10 or so "wood" pieces was scratched. Not one of them came in perfect shape. Vendor is well aware of it, as they send you a brown market to paint over the chipped/scratched sections. The good thing I can say, is that the marker hides those defects effectively. (one of the reasons this gets 2 stars instead of just 1)<br />- Instructions are poor. In one page they will tell you to attached something one way, in the next page the drawing will have them a different way. (the first page was right...)<br />- Hard to align, any slight push from the side readjusts it slightly. lets say align: | |  push a bit to accommodate to a corner and it ends up: / / (obviously not that inclined, but it doesn't keep its shape very well).<br />- Expensive. At around 200 dollars, I was expecting a slightly higher quality product. Say a grade or two above Ikea, as opposed to much lesser quality.<br /><br />If this was made of real wood, (or have at least the outer more visible pieces (say the doors) made of real wood, and scratches were limited, the product would have been a 4 star product. As it stands, given the price tag, and what similar products can be had for at IKEA, I cannot recommend this cabinet.

The two had never been close and hadn't spoken since her husband died a few years before.  Joanna is convinced that her late husband, Max, is haunting her and wants Emma to make him go away.  A few hours later, Emma learns that Joanna's daughter Lainey is in a mental health facility after three attempts to commit suicide.  Lainey and Emma's own daughter are good friends, so Emma pays the young woman a visit.  After the talk, Emma thinks that a ghost might be involved in Lainey's attempts on her own life.  But is it Max or someone else?  Can Emma figure out the cause in time to keep Lainey safe?  I've enjoyed the previous two books in this series, and this was the strongest yet.  The characters, both living and ghostly, are vivid and pull you into the story.  There were times some of the characters were doing some stupid things, but even then I usually felt sorry for them.  The plot moves forward on two levels involving the present and the past.  Both mysteries are compelling, although I usually found myself more involved in the modern mystery.  Yet the historic mystery packed a real emotional punch in the end.  There was a sub-plot I didn't like because Emma was being stupid and complicating her life.  I'll be looking forward to seeing how that gets resolved in future books.  This is a compelling read with great characters that will keep you turning pages until you reach the end.

It's gotten a bit bent up just taking it in and out to clean it, so I finally decided to replace it. Some people seem to have received damaged filters, but mine arrived in pristine condition.<br /><br />Tip for using your Polaris: Odds are very, very high that if the Polaris is not moving around your pool quickly, this filter needs to be emptied and cleaned. If that's not the case, make sure that the plastic nuts that hold your wheels on are tight. If that's not the case, your wheels may be worn and the gears aren't turning them effectively anymore.

It's by far my favorite. It's minty with a bite that I can feel.<br /><br />I ditched the major commercial toothpastes because they contained a lot of chemicals and additives like colorants and artificial sweeteners. I hated Tom's of Maine because of their metal tubes. Hard to squeeze all of it out once it starts emptying out and sometimes the tube would puncture, leaking toothpaste everywhere.<br /><br />Dessert Essence I also didn't like.

In addition to being aesthetically appealing in the bronze, Anolon is a high end, high caliber cookware.  I love every single piece of Anolon I own and use today.<br /><br />What makes this 12&#34; deep skillet distinct is that you can also use it as a wok.  Having the long handle makes it much easier when you stir fry.  One Anolon trademark is that the handles don't tend to get hot when you cook or bake.  Add to it is Anolon is chef tested and restaurant approved.<br /><br />To make a good thing even better, this skillet is not heavy and is very easy to work with.  It cleans easily after each use.  Your food cooks evenly and thoroughly.  Anolon is also noted for its nonstick products and I have had only positive experiences with Anolon products.<br />..

The torque on this drill is obvious when you use it the first time.  this has a dial clutch actuator, so you can choose any torque limit you wish - and the lowest torque setting is a good place to start with small screws! When the drill reaches the torque setting, the drill stops. This drill is well-designed and well-engineered.  It is ideal for tight quarters.<br /><br />The LED is bright and illuminates the workspace well.  When maximum torque is achieved the LED changes to red when the drill stops.  Nice feature.<br /><br />The advantage of the bare tool is that you don't have to buy additional batteries and chargers.  It does not come in a plastic box - which would have been a nice addition.  It uses the new M-18 batteries.<br /><br />Great drill.  Recommended.

10885	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B000J103PC	The Devil Wears Prada (Widescreen Edition)	"Oh, I'm sorry, do you have some prior committment? Some hideous skirt convention you have to go to?"	Pound for pound, no one lays on the vicious snark like a woman targeting another woman. THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA explores a corner of the cutthroat fashion industry, a nerve-wracking environment replete with competitive jealousies and general, all-around meanspiritedness. Into this world steps Anne Hathaway's character, Andrea "Andy" Sachs, an aspiring journalist eager to get a foot in the door. To gain invaluable experience, Andy interviews for a job as the assistant's assistant to the ridiculously demanding Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep), acclaimed head of the trend-setting Runway magazine.<br /><br />Andy is a size six, and this automatically makes her the brunt of mean jokes by those in her new work office. Andy comes from a down-to-earth place and sort of scoffs at her co-workers' unending obsession with haute couture. She promises her boyfriend cook Nate (Adrian Grenier) that she won't change. But of course she does. Andy loses her way.<br /><br />Meryl Streep submits yet another powerhouse performance as the film's dragon lady. Miranda Priestly is the sort of boss who can effortlessly, whimsically shatter an employee's self-esteem. I take in the twitchy reactions of those in her circle and how they tiptoe on eggshells whenever she's in the room, and even I start to sweat. But Meryl Streep is able to sneak in an echo of vulnerability. You may end up sympathizing with her a bit. This actress is just so consistently good.<br /><br />Stanley Tucci himself is masterful in another of his side character roles. I think every movie should have Stanley Tucci in it. Emily Blunt as Miranda Priestly's frazzled first assistant - and Andy's primary foil - is fun to watch, and she makes the most out of her thankless role. When THE DEVIL WEARS PRADA first released in 2006, Anne Hathaway was only then just starting to distance herself from her wholesome teen princess roles. So she was a question mark, going into this film, even with HAVOC and BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN in her rearview.No worries, she confidently steps into this post-Disney role, and she's quite good.<br /><br />Because there's something innately appealing about Hathaway. Even when her character does eventually sell out, you don't hate her. You're not mad-dogging her. You just want her to get back on track. The film easily develops a rooting interest for her. Her immediate boss, the first assistant, is so cruddy in her behavior towards Andy that Andy right away falls into that underdog slot. Except she overcomes that soon enough. Andy, who is brainy enough that she rejected Stanford Law to pursue her journalistic dreams, turns out to be endlessly resourceful in meeting Miranda Priestly's incessant, impossible demands. It's not too long before the first assistant is demoted. Yay for Andy. You could feel her getting more and more sucked into this seductive world. Her long-suffering boyfriend's patience is wearing thin.<br /><br />This film renders me a stranger in a strange land, forced to absorb exotic name brands like Prada, Valentino Garavani, Giorgio Armani, and others I would have to look up on Wiki. I desperately longed for someone to name drop the Gap or Old Navy or Fruit of the Loom, something familiar. Gratifyingly, the story drew me in. The acting fixated me to the screen. I laughed at the right bits and scornfully rolled my eyes at the sheer fanaticism these frantic characters invested in mere articles of clothing. I then went to sleep in my awesome grown-up Underoos.

I was already using these connectors on my dvr to hook up another piece of equipment.  It took me a little time (and extra purchase) to get the @TV connected.  Once I had it connected, I then went to download and install the app on my android phone, which I thought was free.  When I saw the fee for it, I was taken aback.  I "know" that before getting the @TV system, that I had read it was free.  I went back onto Amazon and reread everything.  Then I realized the tricky (in my opinion) wordplay where it says free tablet app.  No, they were not lying, but it's a slight bit shady (once again, in my opinion).  So I then paid the money for the app, on top of the extra money I needed to spend to hook up the connectors.  I've used a slingplayer in the past and understand that the system is going to occasionally have some glitches.  I had problems viewing on my phone more often than I did with the old slingplayer I had used.  Since I have it installed and paid for the app, I will continue to use it some on a limited basis I guess.  Hopefully either future app updates or software upgrades to the system will help things run a bit more smoothly.

10889	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B007X0TTXE	Don 2 [Blu-ray] (Shah Rukh Khan / Hindi Movie / Bollywood Film / Indian Cinema)	It is not just difficult to predict all the plot twists in Don 2, it's impossible!	That review title above is a straight up fib. It's not at all difficult to predict all the plot twists in DON 2. But so what? For fans of Shahrukh Khan and for those who relish slick action thrillers, DON 2 checks all the boxes. It's been five years since the events in DON, five years since that shocking final reveal. But some things don't change. These days, our guy is still running game on the underworld, still outfoxing the badge and his competitors. The woman he betrayed, Roma Bhagat (Priyanka Chopra), is now an Interpol officer. She's obsessed with nabbing him.<br /><br />The film opens with Don holding it down as the undisputed kingpin of the Asian underworld, except that he's now got his eye on a take over of the European drug cartel. On the French Riviera, the European bosses attend an emergency meeting to discuss Don's recent actions. Don is jeopardizing their drug empire by undercutting the asking price of their product. What they decide on is inevitable.<br /><br />Back in Malaysia, Don gets wind of the contract on his head in the rudest of manners. There and then, he determines to be a free man once and for all. He sets into motion one of those whirlwind capers, key elements of which hinge on the springing of his old enemy from prison (Boman Irani) and a daring heist in Berlin. But Don finds himself navigating a nest of vipers, his accomplices composed of deceitful villains. With law enforcement nipping at his heels, has Don at last bitten off more than he can chew? Or does that iconic phrase still hold true? "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahi, namumkim hai." Translation: "It is not just difficult to catch Don, it's impossible!"<br /><br />If you're anticipating a retread of the 2006 film, you need to turn in your anticipating badge. For one thing, there aren't so many swerves in this one. Don does assume a disguise, but it's not as relevant to the plot as much as it is a chance to showcase Hrithik Roshan in a cool cameo (Hrithik even dances with Priyanka).And if that really is Hrithik saying Don's dialogue, then big ups to him for nicely matching Shahrukh's voice and cadence. Don is so gifted, as part of his disguise, he grew a few inches.<br /><br />I thought Priyanka Chopra did well in a role that required her character, Roma, to be conflicted. Don is so magnetic that Roma still can't help but feel that attraction, never mind that Don had betrayed her, never mind that he'd murdered her brother. Thankfully, the film keeps this sub-plot mostly on simmer, never allows it to take over the narrative. Lara Dutta has a lesser role, filling in for Ishaa Koppikar as Don's most trusted companion. Both women look absolutely devastating!<br /><br />The manly man's credo: Give me my popcorn and a comfy sofa and babes to ogle and lots of fight scenes and explosions... and I'm good. Because sometimes and maybe most times, I dispense with the artsy-fartsy stuff and I demand to be entertained by a loud action blockbuster. DON 2 lacks the smarts and fascinating twists of the 2006 film. And I don't know that it was a sound move to inject a sliver of conscience into Don. What made him unique was that he was an unrepentant anti-hero, a straight up, no good villain. Or maybe it doesn't matter. Shahrukh Khan's larger-than-life charisma and his showmanship are stamped onto the screen and your eyes are glued to the guy. Shahrukh also performs his own stunts, again perpetuating the notion that absolutely no one can fill his shoes. I guess, one other contention is that I prefer Don to apply his wits to achieve his ends. Here, he frequently resorts to action hero methods. Ultimately, the 2006 film had built up so much cachet I can't dog on its sequel too much. DON 2 is the Hindi version of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. It's over-the-top and preposterous and great bloody fun. As a fan of Bollywood cinema, I think it's always a treat whenever Boman Irani plays the bad guy. Whether in drama or thriller or comedy, Boman Irani is effortless. There aren't alot of musical numbers here (I think, three). But the tracks all carry strains of "Main Hoon Don," a club banger from the 2006 film and one of the most addictive, catchy Bollywood songs ever. Okay, another beef? How much more clever would it have been if, instead of Hrithik Roshan, it was Abhishek Bachan whose face Don assumes? Abhishek looks enough like his dad, Amitabh, who played the original Don in 1978, that the reference would've been awesome.<br /><br />What I have is the 2-disc DVD set. Disc 1 has the feature presentation, available with English sub-titles and the option to jump to any of the film's three musical segments (this last feature is also available on Disc 2). Disc 2 has the following bonus features:<br /><br />- Making Of featurette (mostly in English, running time 40 minutes)<br />- Songs: "Zaraa Dil Ko Thaam Lo," Hai Ye Maya," "Dushman Mera"<br />- (Promotional?) Music Video from DON 2 featuring Shahrukh Khan: "Mujhko Pehchaanlo"

10891	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B00BUI7HFC	Scrubba Portable Laundry System Wash Bag	THIS works, but you have to understand who it is for!	This product is designed for those who love to spend time in the great outdoors.  Usually you can find a fast moving stream or lake to do your laundry in.  However, many other alternatives to this bag are prone to break or fall apart after a few uses.  This bag is meant to last.  I have never been a fan of using any kind of soap or detergent when in the outdoors.  First off it is not ecologically a good idea to use regular cleaning soap in the outdoors.  You have to worry about polluting the waterways and you also have to be concerned about the smell.  Any kind of smell to soap or other things you use on your body will attract things you do not want near you!!!!  Think insects, bears, etc.........  While those creatures love the smell of city folk.............those who are backpackers or hunters know you do not want to be dinner for the mosquito.  I use a non scented, non polluting soap for washing both clothes and body.  With this little guy you can easily do both.  No need to carry special soap....all you do is take your body soap and shave off a bit with your knife....and place in the bag.  This bag is made to last.  I imagine it will be the last one you ever have to buy.
10892	__label2__	5	N	Camera	B00U2GSQE4	XSories Stuffler 23L Duffel Waterproof Bag with Adjustable Shoulder Strap for Wet or Dry Storage (Orange)	light and bright	Recently a family friend was cleaning out his garage and gave us an old kayak, so we've been tooling around in the bay, learning as we go. One thing we didn't realize we needed was a small dry bag to pack different things in (towel, change of clothes, phone, camera, lunch, whatever) to bring with us, because the kayak lets in water and things get damp very easily.<br /><br />This bag is perfect for that- it's very roomy, but still compact enough that it fits neatly in the boat without taking much room. The orange color is a benefit, because if it does go overboard, or if you leave it on the shore, you can easily spot it from a distance. So far, we've not had the opportunity to set it in the water and leave it for several hours to test just *how* waterproof it is, but it has held up in regular use and in rainy conditions.<br /><br />Perfect bag for kayaking and other water-based sports.

10895	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B0007XBKOA	Windtalkers	WINDTALKERS Draws Attention to Forgotten Heroes.	WINDTALKERS is a good WWII movies filmed over the past few years in that brings attention to these uniquely qualified men of war to draw upon their heritage in this time of global conflict. It is a multi-layered and multi-faceted tale told visually through incredible images enhanced with armor piercing sound effects. The dialogue really has to take a back seat to this simple tale of men and their survival because the images of the land, the bleak faces and the carnage tell it all. This film is named WINDTALKERS but the film does not really focus on the code developed by the Navajo Marines. Director Raoul Walsh had peripherally addressed the Navajo code in 1955 with his film BATTLE CRY with Felix Noriego as Marine Crazy Horse where we saw Japanese operators baffled while listening in on radio and field-telephone transmissions. Director John Woo, as did Raoul Walsh, decides to focus his attention on the men and their diverse backgrounds and what makes them Marines. However, Woo narrows his focus on the relationship between a war-weary, shell-shocked and enigmatic Marine sergeant (Nicolas Cage) and a good-natured naive Navajo recruit (Adam Beach) assigned to him. Beach can't understand the actions or behavior of loner Cage's intensity for killing and bloodshed but learns eventually that if you survive you then increase your chances of having your comrades around you survive as well. Woo is a director noted for action and WINDTALKERS contains some of the most frenetically staged sequences ever filmed. These sequences reminded me of some of Sam Peckinpah's cathartic work from THE WILD BUNCH, the montages of the combat maelstrom of his CROSS OF IRON and the intensity of the intimate fighting of combatants from Edward Zwick's Civil War epic GLORY. This is not action for the sake of action that can be easily labeled on John Woo. Woo is making a statement that all this carnage can be addictive yet simultaneously it usually creates and strengthens intimate camaraderie. But you really can never afford to be close to any of your buddies and this is a highly moral conflict. Is battle weary hardness a symptom or a mechanism to survive? This is the price of defending the ideals that we hold so dear. This is a very subtle and great film that can be easily glossed right over for its true meaning and realization. WINDTALKERS draws attention to forgotten heroes.

10899	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00DBSG80O	Cheez-It Cracker Cup, White Cheddar, 2.2 Ounce (Pack of 10)	Cup container is handy for snacking while driving	These Cheez-It cups are very handy when you want a snack while driving. I find it's easier to reach into the cup and grab a few crackers than into a bag, while trying to keep my eyes on the road. The Cheez-It cup fits into my car's large cup holder, so it's within easy reach and I don't spill them everywhere. The white chedar crackers are milder than the original cheese flavor, but still taste just as great.<br /><br />I like the size and find these are a great teen/adult size snack. We have all kinds of snack packs in our pantry, since I buy for my kids school lunches. They're all quite small. They are usually even smaller than you would get out of a vending machine. I like the larger size of these cups, since generally when I want a snack, it's because I'm really hungry and didn't have time to eat anything. I'd rather just take one 2 oz cup like this with me than 2 or 3 little tiny kid's lunch baggies. I like the size. Perfect for when you're on the go.

Even common pet store shampoos like Furminator and Pet Head are better than this. If you are looking for a natural shampoo that does a great job try Royal Treatment instead of wasting your money on RELIQ.

Fantastic Smithsonian Collaboration about Dinosaurs and Other Fantastic Natural Creatures	It's a coffee table sized book packed full of natural history with brilliant color illustrations and loads of fascinating  facts based on recent scientific discoveries.  I remember getting toy plastic dinosaurs when I was a child and they were all grey or brown with hard smooth skins.  Now some have the colors of birds (or lizards), feathers and other structures that are considered more useful for mating displays than any other purpose. Beginning with a brief exposition of the evolution of animals with backbones, the book goes from the Triassic to the Cenozoic (the rise of the first large mammals)<br /><br />Not just fascinating facts about dinosaurs, but also information about creatures that don't get a lot of attention, like Titanoboa, a gigantic South American snake that was as long as a school bus. There's also the two and half meter tall flightless bird and the Andrewsarchus.<br /><br />I've had this on book on my desk for a week now and it never fails to catch the attention of the numerous adults who wonder through.  They inevitably pick it up and I've had to rescue it a couple of times from being carried off by rapt readers.<br /><br />This one is mine, but I know a couple of dinosaur obsessed children who are going to get copies as holiday gifts.  I thoroughly recommend this book.

10918	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B009AJB0YM	10 Years	Watchable but also forgettable	Just what we needed is another high school reunion romantic comedy featuring mostly impossibly good looking former classmates, all with some hang-ups or dragged baggage.  The cast is fine and each pairing has a story.<br /><br />Channing Tatum is Jake and his real life wife, Jenna Dewan-Tatum is his girlfriend Jess.  He's been working up to popping the big marriage question but puts it off until after the reunion.  Once there he finds his old high school sweetheart, Mary (Rosario Dawson) along with her new husband (Ron Livingston) in tow.  Then we have drunken party boy Cully (Chris Pratt) and his disapproving wife (Ari Graynor).  Also Lynn Collins as the former high school party girl, still trying to live up to that image, but with a secret.  Best friends played by Justin Long and Max Minghella are living on a fantasy reputation and seek to get in Anna's (Collins) pants.  One of the more interesting pairings is Oscar Isaac as Reeves who has become a famous pop star whose long ago crush on Elise (Kate Mara) has been reignited.<br /><br />If this all sounds all too formulaic, well it is.  On the other hand the performances are solid enough and there are enough chuckles and bubbling emotions to keep the audience interested for 90 minutes.  Watchable but also forgettable.
10919	__label2__	4	N	Wireless	B00604RZ12	Belkin Anti-Smudge Screen Protector for Apple iPod Touch 4th Generation (2 Pack)	Easy to Install and Does the Job	Overall, this cover does what it is supposed to do: it protects your iPod's screen and reduces the glare - in my case it helps stop a lot of the smudgy fingerprints.  This one was not too hard to line up and put on, either.<br /><br />Before you install it on your iPod, let me point out a couple of things:<br /><br />1. Clean your iPod's screen with the soft cloth that comes with the screen protector. DO NOT use water to assist you, but use a gentle wiping motion with the cloth. Why? You don't want to put the cover over a bunch of fingerprints and have your fingerprints memorialized on your iPod!<br /><br />2. Make sure you use the straight-edge that comes with it, or a credit card, to help smooth out the bubbles.<br /><br />3. Be patient, line it up, and go slow! This cover doesn't have much wiggle-room to be slightly off - if you go just a fraction at an angle to one side, you will start covering the iPod's edge case vs. the screen. If that happens, slowly back it up and start again.<br /><br />Overall, this is not too bad and does what it is supposed to do, and I think you would rather have a screen protector vs. a scratched up iPod!
10920	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B0058YPG2K	Breaking Bad: Season 4 [Blu-ray]	The fourth season of "Breaking Bad" gets a very good presentation as well as some terrific special features--recommended.	It's fairly typical to say each season after the first of "Breaking Bad" was a game changer but, in this case, the fourth season IS.<br /><br />Blu-ray review (although the contents for the DVD are very much like that for the Blu-ray, they aren't exactly the same). I'd give the season 5 stars but the BD itself 4 because of some transfer issues.<br /><br />SPOILERS:<br /><br />After the cold blooded murder of Gale  (who Gus had hired to eventually replace Walt and Jessie) the unlikely dynamic duo found themselves once again in demand from an increasingly unhappy Gus who STILL had plans to replace them at some point. The murder of Gus pushes Jessie into a dark place he's been before but never quite so deep. Skylar decides that she and Walt must have a way to funnel the massive amount of money he is making and decides to invest in a business.<br /><br />Walt must find a way to get Jessie back knowing that he NEEDS him in particular to eventually put Gus out of the way. He also realizes that as long as Gus can get access to Jessie he man not need Walt any longer and that will put Walt, Skylar and his son in harm's way as well.<br /><br />Gus makes Jessie feel important and takes him in one of the stunning set pieces of the season to the home of a drug kingpin in Mexico where Gus has plans for ultimately eliminating his competition not realizing that Walt has similiar plans of his own.<br /><br />END OF SPOILERS:<br /><br />"Breaking Bad" continues to be one of the best written shows on television and that's saying quite a bit given some of the competition out there both on AMC and other networks. Creator/producer/writer Vince Gilligan continues to craft a dark, compelling TV series. This isn't "lite" entertainment by any stretch of the imagination and those looking for something that will entertain without asking difficult questions and taking characters we like and sometimes admire down the road of temptation should look elsewhere.<br /><br />While the Blu-ray doesn'tlook as stunning as I'd hoped, it looks quite good. There are issues with banding that occur and are particularly noticeable in just about every episode. Most of the previous seasons didn't have this issue that I recall (I'll have to take a look at them again to confirm it)which is why it's perplexing that it's a problem here.<br /><br />The 5.1 lossless DTS audio sounds quite nice with good use of directional effects present throughout. Subtitles are presented in English SDH, French and Spanish for the Blu-ray.<br /><br />The special features are quite nice on this set including videopod casts, commentary tracks (13!) on every episode that are usually quite informative. We also get extended and alternate scenes as well as the "Inside Breaking Bad" featurettes. We also get "Better Call Saul" commercials from the series, an amusing gag reel and a variety of featurettes on the production of the series. We also get "uncensored" versions of episode as well as an extended final episode for the fourth season.<br /><br />The fourth season brings us to the brink with Walt's final descent into the madness of the world he's adopted and the final shot of the episode demonstrates how desperate he is and how that madness consumes him, Jessie and everyone he comes into contact with.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

It fits in your pocket and comes in handy in a pinch.
10923	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00CTGNMIA	Boetje Dutch Mustard 8.5 OZ (Pack of 12)	High-quality product	Boetje's mustard is stoneground and definitely better than most of the mustard on the supermarket shelf. Because it is stoneground, it retains the texture of the mustard seeds (which gives it a bit of body and crunchiness). It has a genuine and strong mustard taste, but it is not obnoxiously spicy or hot. It's perfect for sausages and hamburgers. It's strong enough that it's not overwhelmed by sausages (even spicy ones) and at the same time it doesn't overwhelm a hamburger. It's all natural and contains no preservatives. Here's its ingredients: Water, vinegar, mustard seed, sugar, and salt.<br /><br />I originally became aware of Boetje's mustard while visiting Iowa. I'm glad it's now available here in eastern Nebraska.

10925	__label2__	5	N	Home	B00LAE8HZ0	Hallmark 2014- Limited Edition - High-flying Hero - Disney - The Rocketeer Ornament	The Rocketeer Flies on to Your Christmas Tree	It’s been years since I watched Disney’s The Rocketeer.  (It’s been so long the copy I own is on VHS.)  My memories of the film are dim, but I remember enjoying it.  That’s why I picked up Hallmark’s High-Flying Hero, an ornament based on this character.<br /><br />Not one of the more popular live action films from the 1990’s, it was set in the 1930’s and featured a young man who finds a rocket pack and winds up using it to defeat Nazi’s in Hollywood during the period.  Pure escapist fun, or at least that’s what I recall.  It was based on a lesser known comic book character and definitely has that superhero feel to it.<br /><br />The ornament just features Cliff in his outfit at the Rocketeer.  He’s got tan pants and an orange/brown jacket on and is wearing a helmet, so you can’t really see his face.  His jet pack is on his back with flames coming out of them, and he’s semi-prone because he’s flying off to save the day.<br /><br />Now, even though I’m not a diehard fan of the movie, seeing and buying this ornament still made me smile.  It looks just like my memory of the character, so they did a great job with the sculpt.  And it is nice to see them doing something with a relatively unknown character.  I must not be the only one because this was a limited edition ornament, and it flew off the shelves.<br /><br />Since The Rocketeer is flying here, you really have to hang this ornament to display it.  Not surprising if you look at the ornament, the ring is sticking out of the jet pack.  He looks like he's tipping slightly to one side, but I guess that just means he's turning.  And he hangs at an angle that makes him look like he is rising into the air, a detail I love.<br /><br />It’s nice to see Hallmark taking a chance with a popular but lesser known character.  Based on how popular High-Flying Hero has been, I hope they’ll do more such characters, limited edition or regular line.

At first one would think that it was designed to illuminate an object that you are cutting however I can see a more useful and frequent need for this product.<br /><br />I own many smallish flashlights and many smallish pocket knives because they are convenient items to have around.  I am not a hunter but I find a need for both a light and a knife many times during a day.  This is where I think that this knife fills a niche that few other product fill.  I can clip it to my belt or stick it in my pocket (at least in my state) and have it handy for when I need it.<br /><br />The knife blade was shipped with a good edge on it although I was able to give it a "shave-worthy" edge with just a little effort.  The handle feels cheaper that I would have desired, mostly because of the external battery covers that essentially becomes your gripping surface.  They can be removed in order to exchange the batteries and the knife comes with a tiny screw driver to facilitate the removal of the hex-screws.  I would like it better if the cover was the same color and quality as the knife itself is.

She is twelve with large hands.  I write that to say these picks were the perfect size for her.  She had been using a thinner pick but these are just the right size.  She likes it also that the flexiblity is good  and not rigid is at all.  She said the pick doesn't drag on the strings and the notes are crisp.<br /><br />For the price, she likes it and her mother says she will be buying them for Leah again.  Leah tends to lose picks and these are priced just right for a &#34;semi-disposable&#34; pick.

10930	__label2__	4	Y	Books	052157675X	Inequality, Democracy, and Economic Development	Inequality and democracy: A linkage?	Manus Midlarsky has edited a book based upon a conference on the impact of inequality on democracy. There are 12 chapters in this book (plus an introduction). The chapters take differing looks at the linkage of inequality with democracy. Some are more qualitative, others more quantitative. There is even an effort to use quantitative techniques to analyze Athenian democracy!<br /><br />One of the more interesting chapters is an essay by Edward Muller, in which he statistically analyzes the relationship on inequality to democracy (chapter 5). In several tables reported in this chapter, he finds that greater inequality is associated with lower scores on a democracy index across countries. Another chapter (by Ember, Ember, and Russett) indicates that greater inequality goes with less voice from citizens.<br /><br />Other chapters take a more exotic approach.<br /><br />However, in the end, this is a fascinating, although somewhat idiosyncratic work, on an important subject.
10931	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B003CP0FUU	SONOS PLAY:5 Wireless Speaker for Streaming Music (Black) (Gen 1) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	I absolutely love this speaker, and the SONOS system.	This speaker is great, very powerful and easily loud enough for a small party outside on my patio. Eventually I plan on purchasing a second PLAY:5 to use them as a stereo pair in my bedroom, or to move into separate rooms while cleaning the house.<br /><br />In regards to the SONOS system as a whole; I had initial misgivings before making the purchase, mainly due to price and the effective locking-in to the SONOS ecosystem. I have a variety of Apple products and I'd previously been quite happy using my AppleTV with AirPlay to stream music to my main audio system, but was looking for a portable speaker to use in the bedroom and outside on the patio.<br /><br />I had been very tempted by some of the B&W AirPlay speakers, but I started looking at SONOS tech for the following reasons:<br /><br />- AirPlay from a mobile device can only stream to a single speaker. A laptop or desktop can stream to multiple destinations, but isn't as convenient as an iPhone or iPad for music control.<br />- AirPlay is very dependent on the quality of your home WiFi network. Any interruptions or glitches in the wireless connection will cause issues with the stream.<br /><br />The SONOS system sets up it's own independent WiFi network as to not be impacted by the usage of your home network. SONOS devices stream the music directly from the internet or your music library requiring only your mobile devices (Android / iOS phones and tablets) to be used for remote control.<br /><br />Setup is very easy, authorization of additional devices or controllers is done by a simple button press on an existing device.<br /><br />The core thing to be aware of is that for the SONOS devices to connect to the internet, one of them MUST have an Ethernet connection to your home network. All SONOS devices come with an Ethernet network port, and SONOS sells $50 the BRIDGE device specifically to perform this role if you don't already have another device in range of an Ethernet port.<br /><br />In my case I purchased a PLAY:5 and a CONNECT device. The PLAY:5 is in my bedroom and the CONNECT is hooked up to my home theater receiver via a digital optical connection. The CONNECT plays the part of the BRIDGE as it is connected directly to my home network so I didn't need to purchase a BRIDGE.<br /><br />I can heartily recommend the SONOS system and do so regularly to colleagues, friends, and just about anyone who'll listen.
10932	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B00D0YFKFS	NSSTAR Military Half-finger Fingerless Tactical Airsoft Hunting Riding Cycling Gloves (Black, Medium)	Perfect	I bought these guns for use in firearms training because I need to handle the guns (not just point and shoot at a target) extensively over several hours. Since my hands sweat, these allow me to maintain my grip without losing any dexterity when I am working on various skills for the proper handling of a firearm. They fit well but are not intrusive. I highly recommend them.

10934	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B00GHXUU18	Ivation Ice Ball Maker Mold Tray - Yields 4 Large 2.4 Inch, Spherical, Slow-Melting Ice Rounds - Made from the Highest Grade BPA-Free Silicone - Chill you Drinks Longer without Diluting the Taste	You Might Need Two	This [[ASIN:B00GHXUU18 Ivation 4x 2.5" Silicon Ice Ball Mold Tray]] is a huge hit at Grandma's!  One of these arrived from the manufacturer one day last week and we have been having a blast with it ever since.  This well-made mold makes ice balls about 2 1/2 inches in diameter and is made of food grade silicon, heavy enough not to bend on the way to the freezer.  Yes, it "only" makes four ice balls at a time, but one ball will last an hour in a glass of water and more than two in soda - perfect for drinks (though you may want to pick up some glasses with wider bases).  It's really the "fun" stuff we've been having a ball with though.<br /><br />With the holidays coming and lots of entertaining to be done, we've  put a few mint leaves, a few pieces of fruit or twists of lemon, orange or lime into the bottom half of the mold before adding water for a pretty effect once frozen.  We've also filled  the balls with punch  ingredients (minus any carbonated beverage that you would add), before freezing.  The frozen punch will chill your punch without diluting it.  Frozen ice balls can be removed from the mold and stored in zippered plastic bags in the freezer.<br /><br />Grandma's $0.02 - Great for everyday, dynamite for entertaining.  You might want two of these!<br /><br />Highly recommended

I had the white ones which are ok, but they do stand out. I bought the Black ones at 10$ since sometimes they go up in price.. def worth it at that price and they blend in better than white.  All in all I love these and they keep you from having cords laying around or tangling when not in use.
10936	__label2__	4	N	Grocery	B00CSS40N0	Campbell's Slow Cooker Sauces, Tavern Style Pot Roast, 13 Ounce (Pack of 6)	The vinegar was too strong for my taste,	I do love Campbell's products,  so I will probably order the variety pack to try them all and give the Tavern pot roast to our food bank. The sodium wasn't an issue - I just didn't need to salt the dish. I am not a big mushroom eater so I was pleased to see the mushrooms were minimal, but the vinegar overwhelmed the garlic and mushroom - that was an unpleasant surprise.<br /><br />We make pot roast 6 times a year maybe more. simple recipe. we dry the meat with a paper towel, coat the meat with minced garlic and sear the meat in a cast iron skillet (or pot), then put in in the slow cooker/crock-pot with small potatoes and diced carrots with beef broth for 8 hours on high. So I ordered the Tavern style sauce as an alternative.
10937	__label2__	5	N	Home	B00G00BTEA	McCulloch MC1385 Deluxe Canister Steam System	Wonderful machine	This steam system is great. There are so many different tips/attachments, you can steam clean virtually any surface or object. I was extremely pleased with the results on everything I cleaned with it.<br /><br />I have used it for<br />-floors<br />-shower walls (great for removing hard water buildup up on glass shower doors!)<br />-crevices and corners around the house where dust just accumulates and there's pretty much no way to easily clean it (until I got this steamer)<br />-detailing/designs in wood trims where dust builds up - especially in the bathroom where hairspray on top of dust over and over again, has built up in the detailing of wood trim and cabinet doors and drawer fronts<br />-got all the built up grease and grime off our propane grill and it looks brand new again now inside and out<br />-vinyl siding with moss stains/buildup as well as general dirt and debris from outside<br />-patio furniture<br />-grout lines<br />-mildew stains on a bathroom ceiling<br />-wallpaper - old (decades old) dingy looking wallpaper that has yellowed over the years - used this steamer with the mop head and the wallpaper looks clean and bright again and it makes the room look so much brighter<br /><br />... the list goes on and on. Every time I cleaned something with this machine, I was on the search for something else to clean! I actually found it exciting to be able to get certain things cleaned up and looking new. The results were impressive each time I used it.<br /><br />I had previously used a steam mop on linoleum in my laundry area and I thought it did a pretty good job. The floors seemed clean, but there was some yellowish discoloration in the linoleum that always stayed there. When I used this McCulloch steamer on it, the discoloration mostly went away. The areas that still have the discoloration have faded out a bit and you can't see it as much.<br /><br />I really don't think there is anything you couldn't clean with this thing. There are so many attachmentsto be able to clean virtually anything. Even small tiny areas like buttons and crevices on your small appliances. The possibilities seem endless.<br /><br />All of the attachments can be stored in the tote bag that comes with the steamer. The extending handle makes moving the steamer around very easy. You don't have to carry it  - just roll it. It seems pretty well made and solid.<br /><br />This is a great machine to have because you can clean everything with it. It is definitely worth the investment. It might seem like a hassle to drag it out and use it, but once you do use it, you probably won't have to use it on the same item again for a while .. like the detailing in wood trim for example .. once you do it, it will be while before the buildup is bad enough again to need to use this steamer. My patio furniture I am planning to do yearly and it sure beats buying new furniture or cushions every year. We were going to get new grill plates for the grill this summer, but now we don't even have to because this did such a great job on it. Everything you see in the video up there on this page is true - this machine cleans just like it shows and does an excellent job.

10939	__label2__	5	Y	Home Improvement	B00314YBPM	Stop-A-Clog Drain Protectors - 2 Pack	These work well.	I have thick hair that gets in the tub/shower drain, gets stuck in the pipe, and clogs it up. These don't catch all the hair, but they do reduce the volume of hair that gets down the drain. When the drain slows from accumulated hair, I pour white vinegar and baking soda down the drain, wait 15 minutes, run hot water down the drain, and then I use a plunger on top of the drain to create a vacuum and push any leftover clog around the pipe bend, so there's no more obstruction and the tub drains fast.. Between these drain protectors and that cleaning method, I don't have to clean the drain often and I don't have to use toxic products. And at the cheap price for these (and they're  biodegradable), I can replace them when they get more built-up soap scum than I like. You can also clean them in the dishwasher, or soak them in water and a little bleach if you like.

It functions very well and has a one year warranty as a real plus! This voice recorder can provide a lot of fun but I would not use it to &#34;snoop&#34;. That would not be something that I would ever do! As for using it for a business undertaking, this is perfect! You can record a meeting and review it at a later time. This is a good value for something this sophisticated. If you are expecting &#34;high fidelity&#34;, this does not go quite that far so don't use it for to record a symphony orchestra concert with high expectations. What you can do is record a visit by your grandchildren, download the file to your computer and you have the memories to listen to again and again. Highly recommended.

I have other tripods and the best I can say for them is that they provide stability at the expense of flexability.  This tripod is significantly superior in quality and versatility.<br /><br />For me,it is essential that any accessory be easy to set up and use. If it is too unwieldy or time-consuming, I will not use it.  I am left handed and left to my own devices would put everything together upside down and inside out.  Although the directions were a bit skimpy, I was able to set this device up with a minimum of frustration.  Similarly, it is easy to use once you get the hang of it.<br /><br />I found it very sturdy but still light enough to lug around from venue to venue. After a few practice sessions at home, I had no difficulty adjusting the tripod and was amazed at the flexibility.  I also appreciated the fact that it extended above five feet.  My other tripods are shorter and being somewhat tall, their lack of height was something of an annoyance.<br /><br />Unquestionably of professional grade, this tripod provides easy to use versatility and is sure to stimulate the creative juices.

Been using almost daily for about 2 months now.  I only use wood or plastic (no metal) when cooking but they are holding up great.  Still non-stick and still cook evenly.  I did quickly learn that the handles can't handle heat at all so if you are using gas, be sure the flame isn't larger than needed for pot size.  Or you will have a super smelly kitchen.

I attached the remotes to the wall and now have easy control of all the lighting in the room.

At a weight of 250 lbs, this is basically useless.  Also, unless you have fairly good coordination, I think it will be difficult to utilize.  I had hoped to use it in conjunction with my weight loss program.  Not a chance!  First off, I'm too awkward to do much of what it is set up to do, and secondly I think I will need to lose the weight first and then try the board again.<br /><br />Other family members tried it and had some success with different games, but none of them had much interest in getting it out of the closet again.  So it sits...and sits...and sits.  Someday perhaps I will try it again, but that is about 50 lbs away.

I own several Kensington products and have been pleased with most all of them.  This case is indeed, beautiful but it has some design flaws that a cover/keyboard in this high price range should be addressed.  Firstly and most importantly... It is HEAVY!  The reason that many people buy an iPad Air is because of it's SUPER lightweight (1.5 lbs) design.  Adding this keyboard/case DOUBLES the weight to 3 lbs. You cannot turn the IPad into the portrait position and the clasp on the cover is metal and can hit and scratch your IPad screen.  The cover itself is beautiful and looks very professional.  I just can't honestly give this product any more than 3 stars due to the design flaws...

We put this mailbox up a week ago - took my boyfriend 30 minutes I think, using the adapter - available on amazon for $13; super easy - snaps onto the bottom of this mailbox & allows you to easily attach this to a wooden 4x4 post.  This replaced our incredibly old quintessential metal mailbox.<br /><br />I'm a serious online shopper (although oddly enough I bought this at walmart for $30) - but I tend to get anywhere from 5-20 packages a week.  Most come from UPS, but a few come via USPS.  The other day I was expecting 2 from USPS so when I saw him drive on without bringing anything up to the door I was kinda annoyed.  Until of course I went out to the mailbox - where I was shocked to see that both packages fit in this thing!!!  I bet my mailman loves me now, since he'll rarely have to get out any more!!<br /><br />This will also fit most of the packages I mail out each week - before I would have to put some on the ground & leave a sticky note for my mailman pointing down - again, I'm sure he'll appreciate not having to get out and pick those up.<br /><br />I uploaded a pic of everything that fit in there the other day...and there was still room for more!!<br /><br />This totally exceeded my expectations...I love it!!

10962	__label2__	4	N	Electronics	B00DDPZ4FA	MEE audio Sport-Fi M6P Memory Wire In-Ear Headphones with Microphone, Remote, and Universal Volume Control (Black)	Good Headphones Especially for the Price	Although I'm not an audiophile, over the past few years, I've had the opportunity to use and try several different types of headphones. Recently, I had the opportunity to use and try the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EAR HEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL.  For the retail price these headphones sell for, they are an incredible good buy. I've had some headphones that cost around $150 and the MEE ELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6-P HEADPHONES are just as good in sound quality as those.<br /><br />These headphones are more like earbuds since they actually go inside one's ear instead of over them. However, unlike some other earbuds I've used, these hurt my ears after extended use.  Each part of the headphone is designed for a particular ear: one piece has a small "R" for the right side of one's head while the other is marked with a "L" for the left side of one's head.  The design of the earbuds also makes them good for exercise. However, as I've only used them while briskly walking, I can't say for sure how they will do while running or doing more strenuous exercise. However, the headphones do come equipped with a small clip (like a microphone clip) that can clip on to a piece of clothing.<br /><br /> In terms of aesthetics, I don't like the look of these headphones. It's not a terrible design, but even in the black color I just don't find them as visually pleasing as other headphones I've used and seen.<br /><br />While listening to music are a video with the headphones on, the sound doesn't escape the headphones unless the volume is turned up extremely high. Also, although they aren't designed as ear plugs, the headphones also work rather well at keeping most outside noises out.<br /><br />These headphones are also equipped with a microphone and volume control. I have not used these headphones as a microphone so I can't say how they function in that capacity.<br /><br />Overall, the MEELECTRONICS SPORT-FI M6P NOISE ISOLATING IN-EARHEADPHONES WITH MICROPHONE, REMOTE, AND UNIVERSAL VOLUME CONTROL are a good set of headphones for the price.
10963	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00AMEINDA	Calico Critters Supermarket Set	Highly engaging with very good educational value	This supermarket set is indeed a very creative and sturdy toy. The build quality is very solid and the colors on plastic pieces are very bright and realistic. The supermarket items look like real-life with their creatively designed colors and shapes.<br /><br />It is very engaging for young kids (3+ years) and carries an exceptional educational value. As an adult you can teach the variety of products to kids, and focus on things like counting, addition, subtraction etc.<br /><br />This toy does require some time to set up and then one has to keep track of all the small pieces, which can be lost easily. It will appeal to around kids of 3-8 years of age and has potential to be used for long time (not just a few months). If you have other Calico family toy, this one will fit right in the collection.<br /><br />With so many little parts, you have to be cautious if there are other younger babies or infant in your home who can possibly swallow them.<br /><br />A little pricey toy, but the value of money is huge with years over years of use.

10968	__label2__	5	N	Sports	B00HLG9QPG	Procella Umbrella Golf Umbrella 62-Inch Large Tested By Skydivers Windproof Auto Open Rain & Wind Resistant (Black)	Extra Beverage For Your Bag	This Procella 62 inch golf umbrella is a great value. My gold standard umbrella is a 68 inch Gustbuster Titleist branded umbrella. The Procella stacks up well in comparison, and is less expensive.<br /><br />The Procella umbrella has some great features - the handle is rubberized beefy, with a golf grip style pattern. With one button press the umbrella shoots open - a super nice feature when it starts raining and you want to get under the umbrella quickly. This is a double canopy umbrella, meaning the top two thirds of the umbrella are covered with a second layer. That second layer is vented to the main canopy. Inside the umbrella mesh covers the opening between the two layers - this is super nice because it improves the strength of the fabric.<br /><br />Those are features the Procella has that are better than the Gustbuster. The Procella weighs a half pound less than the Gustbuster (1 pound 8 ounces to 2 pounds). I guess you could get an extra beer in your golf bag for the weight savings - advantage Procella. Both have similar sewing and cloth for the canopy - neither is perfection. They are both pretty close to the same length (the Gustbuster is about 6 inches longer, but that's really negligible), and are the same diameter when wrapped up closed (they both fit in a standard golf bag umbrella holder). The Gustbuster is a bigger umbrella (well you knew that, 62 inches versus 68), the difference is actually more significant than you might imagine. You will probably never get wet underneath either umbrella, but that extra six inch diameter and deeper dome might come in handy. Slight advantage Gustbuster. They both have sturdy spines or skeleton. The Gustbuster went with a single spar and used a thicker material. Procella went with smaller spars and a second support rod. Don't think one is really that much better than the other - they will both work.<br /><br />The Gustbuster has two big differences. The first one is price; it is a lot more expensive. When I wrote this review the Procella is selling for $35 and I paid $65 for the Titleist umbrella. Gustbusters can be purchased without a brand on them for around $50. Huge advantage for Procella.<br /><br />The second big difference is the upper canopy, and this may or may not be worth all the extra money. Gustbuster added elastic hold down strips to the upper canopy. If there is a really strong wind, the upper canopy can actually lift away from the umbrella allowing more air to flow through the umbrella. That little tiny difference could be the difference between the umbrella flying away and keeping ahold of it. I'm not sure how frequently that would come into play - it might be so nasty out at that stage, you should be in the clubhouse anyway (or have on rain gear).<br /><br />The Procella I was sent for testing is a blue and white umbrella. I like the look a lot, the blue is a nice deep royal blue and the company name and logo is printed in black on a white section. The umbrella looks handsome - my wife said she wouldn't hesitate to grab this umbrella; she would leave the Titleist behind - too much golf logo for her taste.<br /><br />Oh it is a onetime thing; the box the umbrella came in is really pretty. This arrived in the middle of winter and the picture around the box is a beautiful blue sky with a perfectly placed golf ball on some fairway grass. Yes, that's what dreams are made of.<br /><br />The Procella golf umbrella is a great reasonably priced alternative to more expensive umbrellas. And because it is that much lighter than the others, you can get an extra beverage in your bag for the same weight.

10970	__label2__	3	N	Musical Instruments	B001U0ORJE	DW Drums Retro-Style Bass Drum Single Tom Mount	Not solid at all, but fits vintage rail mount hole patterns	My mount came on my DW special edition Buddy Rich tribute kit in the Classic series. It has some nice features like a quick tightening lever in the L-rod, and it came with some semi-nice features like the memory lock on the rail. The latter may be useful to some folks, but it also takes up some real estate on the rail itself, diminishing how far you can shift the tom position.<br /><br />While the construction is typical DW perfection, the design is not. It incorporates the worst aspects of a rail mount. Specifically, it slips. A simple light knurling on the rail or the inside of the clamp that grabs it would have prevented that. I have to brace the rack tom that is on my kit against my snare drum to hold it in position. To me that is a major failing.<br /><br />On the plus side, the hole pattern will fit the Walberg & Auge rail that was used by Ludwig, Slingerland, Leedy and others when this was the way to mount a tom. I measured it on my 1961 Slingerland lit as well as a Gretsch round badge kit. Of course it will not fit the Ludwig models that had the four-hole pattern that they used in the 1960s.<br /><br />Also, if you are making a purchase decision as to whether this or the [[ASIN:B0016HCG94 Gibraltar SC-GVRM Vint Rail Mount 10.5Mm L-Rod]] will best suit your needs I would personally opt for this one. I have owned and used both and this one is better constructed and sits a little lower for approximately the same price (at the time of this review).  However, be aware that both are flawed and both have slipping problems.<br /><br />If you are looking for a rail for a vintage kit you may want to check out the Steve Maxwell rail that is easy enough to find with a web search. That one is built to the old Walberg & Auge specs,  but with better tolerances and is actually less apt to slip than this DW rail or the Gibraltar model.<br /><br />I love my DW kit, but this rail is the weak link.

But doesn't switch to "warm" automatically	The BELLA Programmable Slow Cooker lets you choose the temperature (High, Low, or Warm) and the time (from 30 minutes to 20 hours, in 30 minutes increments). However, it does not automatically switch to Warm when the High or Low time has expired.  So you need to be home at the end of the cooking time.<br /><br />I have used this for one recipe so far, and the chicken was done just right.  So I think the temperature must be about the same as other slow cookers.<br /><br />The controls are quite simple.  The instructions in the booklet don't match the actual device (the book refers to a non-existent "Time" button), but you really don't need instructions.  Just pick the temperature and pick the number of hours, and then it starts.<br /><br />I think this slow cooker is more attractive in real life than in the picture.  It looks like a cheap, bright red in the picture.  It is actually a rich deep red, not quite a brick red but leaning that way.

I like to have material recorded onto a DVD disc so that I can watch it on my standard DVD player.<br /><br />This unit can also record via the internal hard drive. The material that you record in the hard drive can be kept there or archived onto a DVD disc. The transfer process is pretty easy(kind of like the old VHS to DVD transfers).<br /><br />And there is also a digital tuner that works reasonably well. Connections include S-Video, Component Video, and standard A/V. Overall this is a good machine that is hard to find nowadays and can be rather pricey.

10974	__label2__	3	N	Grocery	B00F9X5FT4	Andria's Brush On Steak Sauce, 15 Ounce	Andria's Brush-on Steak Sauce Is More Like A Soy Sauce Gravy.	ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE. 15 FLUID OUNCES (450 mL). Why this is called a steak sauce, is the question of the day. It tastes like a brown brisket (not the red corned beef brisket) gravy made from boiled down beef brisket meat juice, along with the strained carrots, celery and onions. The next time I cook a brisket and run out of gravy, I can always use Andria's instead. Andria's is not a steak sauce, it is a brisket style gravy, with added soy sauce. The label mentions marinating a steak in it, and brushing it on a steak during cooking. Maybe I will use it if I overcook a steak until it is dry and brown inside like a brisket, -otherwise, no thank you. Andria's is also a bit salty, and contains 400 mg of salt per tablespoon, about what you would get in a hotdog, and hotdogs are considered salty to begin with. People with high blood pressure and on a low salt diet may want to avoid this sauce altogether. Andria's also contains soybeans, giving it a bit of a soy sauce flavor. It might be suitable for use on Chinese food in place of regular soy sauce, but not for use on a steak. As far as I am concerned, this is fifteen ounces of expensive gravy or soy sauce. Be careful when pouring, as the bottle does not have a soy sauce shaker top, and you can easily dump it out all at once. The Nutrition Facts and INGREDIENTS as listed on the label are as follows:  Nutrition Facts: Serving Size 1 tbsp (15 g), Servings per container 30. Amount Per Serving: Calories 10 (Calories from fat 0), Total Fat 0 g (Saturated Fat 0 g, Trans Fat 0 g), Sodium 400 mg, Total Carbohydrate 2 g (Sugars 1 g), Protein 0 g.

Their spelling mistake, not mine). Allergens: Contains Soybeans, Wheat, Dextrose.  The EXP date is stamped in black on the top of the white bottle cap.  If you walk down the supermarket aisle, and you see the label &#34;ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE&#34;, you naturally think that it is what it says it is, a steak sauce. You won't notice the fine print on the back label until you get home. I will type the label information exactly as it is on the back label: &#34;AFTER OPENING STIR WELL KEEP REFRIGERATED For Charcoal Broiling or Oven Broiling, Baking, or Grilling. Also add to Ground Meats, Stews, and Gravies. Can be Used as a Microwave Browning Agent. BRUSH-ON Before and During Cooking Beef, Chops, Hamburger, Roasts, Meat loafs, Etc. Also Excels as a Marinade.&#34;  It may be a matter of definitions, but in my best attempt to decipher the purpose of this sauce, it is a marinade that you put on meat prior to cooking, and it can also be used as a basting &#34;Browning Agent&#34; during cooking to keep the meat from drying out. It also mentions adding it to gravies, which makes sense, as this sauce tastes like a gravy already. If this sauce is really meant for cooking, it should not, I repeat, not, mention steak sauce on the front label. A steak sauce is something that you put on your steak after it is cooked and placed on your plate, regardless of whether you choose to brush it on or pour it on. I hope that this note has helped folks to clear up any confusion that they might have as to what ANDRIA'S BRUSH-ON STEAK SAUCE really is. Purist human carnivores even prefer making do with a little salt and black pepper on their steak. Myself, I prefer adding a steak sauce, and this Andria's sauce is definitely not a steak sauce.

This consists of a sheet of plastic with punched out letters.  I agree with other posters that the seller should be more specific about how large the individual letters are rather than the size of the overall sheet.  One work-around is to download the jpg, size it to 7x10&#34;, and print it out.  This will give you a very good idea of the sizes.<br /><br />The main problem I have with stencils is not securing them tight enough to the item I am stenciling.  In this case, I found it much easier to cut the individual words out and tape them down tightly.<br /><br />All in all, this is a fine product and I will get a lot of use out of it.

10979	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B00DCLTA6Y	Sharknado	Best or Worst Movie Ever	There may be spoilers.<br /><br />I feel a little guilty giving this movie two stars.  In actuality it is one of the worst, dumbest movies ever made.  However, I think that is much of the point of these offbeat movies made for the SyFy Network.  You could easily make an argument that for investment purposes, this may be one of the best movies ever.  Made for $1 million, it's a big hit.  So here's the deal.<br /><br />Fin Shepard (Ian Ziering) is a former surfing champ who now owns a bar on the beach near L. A.  As a hurricane brews off the Mexican coast, strong winds move up the California shoreline.  Water spouts begin to appear at the same time as a large school of sharks.  Before you know it, the large water spouts pick up the sharks and start depositing them inland.  At the same time the tropical storm is flooding everything.  This give the re-deposited sharks access to the storm drains as well as an occasional swimming pool.<br /><br />Fin along with an Australian surfing buddy Baz (Jaason Simmons), George (John Heard), the local drunk and a hot employee named Nova (Cassie Scerbo) head for the hills (literally) to look in on Fin's ex-wife, April (a stone faced Tara Reid), his teenage daughter, Claudia (Aubrey Peeples) and college aged son, Matt (Chuck Hittinger).  Well Matt's away at flight school or something, April and Claudia insist they don't need help.  That is until a flying shark eats April's new boyfriend.<br /><br />So most of the movie has sharks appearing from everywhere eating everything and everyone in their path.  Fin and company concoct a plan to have flyboy Matt and Nova take a helicopter up into the now 3 tornados and toss in an improvised bomb which will defuse the tornado and kill the sharks contained therein.  And guess what?  It works.  One casualty is Nova when she is taken off guard and swallowed by a flying great white shark.<br /><br />Although for most of the movie, I thought Nova was going to be Fin's girlfriend, it turns out she's better suited for son Matt.  That way Fin can reunite with April.  But wait, Nova was swallowed by the great white.  No matter.  Fin armed with a chain saw, manages to find the same fish and dive in head first, cutting his way out from the inside and saving Nova for Matt.  I have to admit to laughing out loud for much of the film.  I was especially caught up in several lines uttered that came verbatim from "Jaws."  Like I said, this may be the worst or best movie ever.

Imagine my surprise when Angie unrolled two big tunnels that had been in the box and left them on the floor for me to explore as well. I sniffed at the dangling toys at the entrance and crawled inside the big tunnel.  It makes a VERY satisfying rustle when I move through it, which is fun, and it has a window in the middle that lets me peek out at the people. I enjoyed exploring the tunnel and then capped off the experience by settling inside for a nice nap.<br />The small tunnel didn’t interest me too much, but I’m a BIG cat, and kittens might enjoy it more. I might even let my sister Rikki play with it so that she’ll leave MY BIG tunnel alone.<br />I get bored with even the best toys after a while, so Angie puts them away until they are likely to pique my interest again. The big tunnel has three hook-and-loop mechanisms to hold the tunnel shut when it is folded, which makes it easy to store, and the little tunnel can be secured shut using the loop on the dangling toy. The tunnels look well-made, and I think we'll have them to play with for a long time.<br />All in all, this was that rare Amazon delivery where I’d rate the contents higher than the box. Since the boxes themselves are usually five-star items, in my opinion, these tunnels certainly deserve the highest rating. I am sure discriminating cats in your household will agree!

I'm not a totally gear-head - I do tend to prefer cameras that work well in pure automatic mode, reserving manual fine tuning for rare occasions.  In other words, a camera that is only serviceable via RAW mode is no use for me.  I have three cameras in my arsenal right now, the [[ASIN:B0075SUFLE Canon PowerShot A4000IS 16.0 MP Digital Camera with 8x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom 28mm Wide-Angle Lens with 720p HD Video Recording and 3.0-Inch LCD (Red)]], [[ASIN:B005MTME3U Canon PowerShot S100 12.1 MP Digital Camera with 5x Wide-Angle Optical Image Stabilized Zoom (Black)]], and the [[ASIN:B0002XQJFA Canon EOS 20D 8.2MP Digital SLR Camera with EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 Lens]].  The A4000IS is really the camera for the kids, but the S100 is my pocket camera and the 20D DSLR is my good camera for when I don't mind the weight.<br /><br />So where does the Fuji H50EXR fit into this picture?  This is a bridge camera, with the body profile of a DSLR, but the lens is not interchangeable and the cost is far less.  There are plenty of extensive reviews on the web, so I'm hoping my review can provide insight beyond the encyclopedic coverage on features you will never use.<br /><br />In short, this camera has three strong points going for it - the 42x zoom, the 24mm wide angle, and the f2.8 aperture opening.  That's not to say there aren't other great features (like a bright LCD, HD movie recording, etc), but those are what sets it out at this price point.<br /><br />Most people know why 42x zoom is important.  Note that this is a purely optical zoom, not digital.  Digital zoom just takes a high resolution photo and pre-crops it.  Optical zoom preserves the image quality.  With the 1000mm lens, you can zoom into far away objects quite easily.  The zoom is manual, a nice feature when zooming during a video, or when you need to zoom quickly.  Many cameras are near useless at maxmium zoom without a tripod because the image blurs, but the built-in image stabilization means that the 42x is quite usable.<br /><br />It is also nice that the lens can go to 24mm.  That means you can do easier shots indoors when the subject is near you - this is effectively a wide-angle or macro-type setting.  Many super zoom lenses cannot also do the 24mm setting.<br /><br />So what is f2.8 and why should you care?  The f-setting refers to how wide the aperture can open.  While the f2.8 only applies at the widest setting, it is significantly better than competing cameras, many of which are closer to f3.5.  In dark rooms, a camera with a lower f-setting will let in more light and get lighter pictures with shorter exposure time.<br /><br />What else does the camera offer?  It has some cool features such as a built-in panorama stitch mode and a 480fps movie mode for making slow-motion videos.  These features are mostly for fun.  The panorama stitch mode unfortunately only does vertical resolution of 1080 pixels, or less than 1/3 the normal vertical resolution of a still photo.  The 480fps mode also is extremely low resolution and is neat, but almost unusable as the video is so hard to see.<br /><br />There are some facts of life with this camera.  You can't get a pitcher of orange juice from one orange, nor can you get the best images from a small sensor and smaller optics.  The sensor is small, only 1/2", which means that images will have more noise than DSLR cameras with larger sensors.  While large sensors have started to filter into the lower-end space, they don't come in cameras that have 42x zooms or cost less than $500.  Camera specifications for a given price range have give and take.  The [[ASIN:B00BF9MUAS Sony NEX-3NL/W Compact Interchangeable Lens Digital Camera Kit (White)]] might have a large beautiful sensor, but the kit lens is only 55mm, not 1000mm.  Add on a better lens and you're into DSLR territory.  In short, a camera must be evaluated on imagequality within the price range of the camera.<br /><br />There are some similar market competitors with even better zooms for similar camera bodies, but of course many don't have all of the extra features like panorama or the really wide aperture.<br /><br />All of that being said, it's a 4 star camera.  I was disappointed that they didn't include a manual and I had to download it off the web.  I couldn't find any method to show a histogram of the picture during review, a useful feature to know if the photo is properly exposed.  It has since been pointed out to me how to do it, so I can say it does have histogram, but I still couldn't find it easily.  The camera screen also didn't give me useful feedback in manual mode to know if the picture would be properly exposed once taken as I adjusted the aperture and shutter speed.  I had to click and find out.  A manual focus wheel, a multi-purpose adjust dial, and a "quick" menu are a manual do-it-yourselfer's dream, but you will take some time to get used to these.<br /><br />I also found the user interface a little cumbersome.  Given that this is a new camera, it's about time they went touchscreen and got rid of all of these buttons.  Browsing and zooming on photos you took requires two buttons near the front of the top and the scroll wheel on the back.  In quite a few uses, you will find yourself going all over the camera looking for the right button.  I acknowledge that some of this may be familiarity - I know Canon better than Fuji - it just seems that they didn't make this as easy as they could have for new photographers.  The interface just felt clunky and not well organized.<br /><br />Other shortcomings?  The flash must be manually opened and the zoom is also a little stiff compared to my DSLR to turn.  Truthfully, the camera is surprisingly heavy for its position as a bridge camera.  It's honestly not much lighter than my DSLR, and when I went out with it on a hike today, wondered why I didn't just bring my DSLRalong.  Granted, I normally carry a 270mm lens and not a 1000mm one, but I was still surprised by the weight.  That being said, not everyone can afford a DSLR, making this an excellent choice as a value high-end camera.<br /><br />Despite smaller shortcomings, this is a nice camera that you can take from the box, put into "auto" mode, and start taking nice photos.  If you value the 1000x zoom, the f2.8 setting, and the lower cost, it is a fine choice for general purpose use and for a low-cost alternative to a DSLR that gets you a wide aperture and excellent zoom.

Very notable performance improval in each of my phones since I put them in.  These worked well.  Much better than buying some at &#34;Batteries Plus&#34; last time, and getting stale batteries.  these seem fresh and strong.
10988	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B007A2Z3Y4	Justified: Season 3	Complex, rich plot, many threads (no spoilers)	After two excellent seasons, the question is: how much longer this show can keep up with its own success?<br /><br />Where season two had a build-up that went through the whole season, it took me awhile to figure out where this one was headed.  Lots of new bad guys were introduced, and dispatched.  But lots of plot threads were introduced and developed.  Eventually, one especially noticeable bad guy appeared, and didn't get dispatched, so it became clear how the season would wind up; the only remaining question was how it would unfold.<br /><br />The bad guy was a prominent one-season bad guy from another TV show.  He does creepy really well.  In the interest of avoiding any kind of spoiler, I won't say who it is, but those of you who saw that other show a couple years ago will recognize him immediately.<br /><br />I don't know if it was the complexity of all the plot threads, or whether they were presented less clearly as in previous seasons, but it wasn't always obvious why things were happening.  There are many things to note and remember to really get what's going on, but the problem is there are many other things that aren't essential to the main thread going on, too.<br /><br />There are hints about how it will all end sprinkled liberally through the plot.  Even so, it is satisfying to watch it all unfold.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: Four Stars ("I Like It").  I thought the first two seasons were excellent, and this was a small notch down.  I'll watch the fourth season.
10989	__label2__	4	Y	Sports	B0001LSY7O	NCAA Michigan 4-Pack Team Golf Ball Gift Set	Repair tool great -- balls look cheap	I bought this to replace a ball mark repair tool I lost.  I love this style because it has the regular size ball marker (the size of a quarter), but also has a second, dime-sized ball marker (for marking someone else's ball, for example).  It's good quality construction.<br /><br />The four balls that are included look very cheap.  There is an obvious seam on each ball, and the "M" logo's are missing some detail, like it was rubbed off.  I haven't hit them because I don't want to hurt my clubs! (I expect they feel like rocks).  They're nice for display cases, I suppose.
10990	__label2__	4	N	Camera	B00AQDG99M	Sony DSC-W730 16.1 MP Digital Camera with 2.7-Inch LCD (Silver) (OLD MODEL)	Very portable, but photo quality is so-so.	This Sony DSC W370 is light, and small enough to slide into a pocket easily. For people with big hands, you might want to attach a long strap to the camera to prevent dropping it by mistake. The menu system is pretty intuitive for settings. Nevertheless, this's a simple point-and-shoot, not much settings for me to play around. The screen is large and bright enough to see on a moderate sunny day. The small battery is the same as the one used in my Sony DSC-TX10. Be aware, the small battery won't hold too much charge (I learned it from using my Sony DSC-TX10), if you plan to use the camera for a long day, you should get a backup battery. The backup batteries are quite available in Amazon, with pretty good price.<br /><br />The built in flash is strong enough to improve the lighting condition for objects in 6 feet range. Time from power-off to photo taking is less than 2 second, which is good for this small camera. The delay between shot is about 1 second if no flash light is used. When flash light is used, you need to wait a little bit longer for charging the flash light, this is pretty typical for camera in this price range.<br /><br />The photo quality is just ok as the photo does not seem to be sharp. When shooting indoor where lighting is weak, you can see some grainy photos. The problem is less when shooting outdoor with good lighting.<br /><br />In video taking mode, the menu already declares that zooming noise will be captured by the camera. I usually edit my videos, so I can silent the zooming noise from the video clips. Not a big issue to me. When you move your camera around in video mode, the camera adjusts the focus continuously. This is a camera, not a camcorder. So, don't move camera too fast, this gives camera time to adjust focus continuously.<br /><br />The panorama mode is just for fun as the panorama photo quality is not very impressive. If you are seriously in creating panorama photos, I recommend to take still shots and create the final panorama photo with photo editing software.<br /><br />The 8x lens is a big selling point for such a small point-and-shoot camera. But the image stabilization does not seem to be strong enough. So, you need a very steady hand to take advantage of the 8x lens, otherwise the photo will be blurry.<br /><br />All in all, for price under $100, this would be a good buy. For price in the $130 range, there might be better options around.

So far so good, but the scent is heavily grapefruit that annoys my nose.  Great price, however, as I've noticed L'Oreal on Amazon is much cheaper than in store.  I plan on using this MORE during the summer when I'm using heavier sunscreen to get that out of my pores.<br /><br />Will post if neck bumps clear off.
10992	__label2__	2	Y	Tools	B000R7LZH8	Mechanix Wear Heat Sleeves	Way Too Small - Petites Only	Much too small for a man's arm.  These barely fit my 5' 3&#34; petite wife who weighs 109 pounds.  I can barely manage to pull them past my elbow and it is bordering on pain even with my arm outstretched, let alone when I bend my elbow.  I am extremely disappointed in the size.  I don't know if this material shrinks in the wash, but if it does, even my wife will have trouble with it. I'm 6 feet tall and weigh 185 pounds and not so much of it is fat. My BMI is 25.<br /><br />I will have to keep looking for a long arm length sleeve that I can wear outdoors while wearing a short sleeved shirt. I thought this one had the best potential, but obviously not.  I want it primarily to prevent sunburn while driving and doing yard work or playing tennis. I am open to referrals for a bigger size.

10995	__label2__	4	N	Wireless	B00V3RIUMO	CTA Digital Compact Mirror 5000 mAh External Battery Charger - Retail Packaging - Silver	Interesting, Functional Battery Hybrid	I do love strange little hybrid ideas... and this is indeed a strange little hybrid idea indeed.  But functional one, which is not always the case.  Slight twist to the right to open the compact.  The mirror is highly reflective safety plastic (what is used for rear-seat safety mirrors) and makes your face appear smaller, basically fitting my head into the reflection with it about 1 foot away from my face.<br /><br />The 5000mAh battery itself performs on par with expectations, it's single port rated at 2.1A - thus charging iPhone 6 at optimum speeds as well as most large tablets.<br /><br />I guess my only slight reservation is the compact interior.  The rather drab, utilitarian black paper covering of the battery portion could use some sort of face lift (pun intended... I know, I know).<br /><br />-- I received this as a complimentary review product with the aim of hopefully elucidating features and drawbacks that may help you ultimately decide what fits your needs and budget best.
10996	__label2__	4	N	Wireless	B00NM9OC46	Belkin Classic Case / Folio for iPhone 6 / 6S (Blacktop)	Nice and functional folio case	This is a nice folio type case for the iPhone 6. The matte cover has a smooth, rubberized and non-slippery feel to it. The iPhone is securely snapped in a built-in plastic cradle inside. The ring/silent switch, volume buttons, headphone jack and lightning connector are fully exposed, which means any third party lightning cable with a bigger connector should be able to plug in without obstruction. The interior of the front cover has a slot for storing a couple of credit cards and driver license (any more cards would make it uneven and too bulky).<br /><br />Another great feature is that the folio case can be converted into a stand for the iPhone (in landscape mode). The back cover folds back a little for the phone cradle to stand on the interior of the front cover. It works pretty well when you want to watch a video clip or use video chatting. In addition, the back has a nice, clean oval cutout for the rear camera and flash.<br /><br />I like this folio case for the added protection against drops since the phone cradle is recessed from the outer edges of the folio covers. The extra margin helps absorb impact from a drop. On the other hand, this makes the case slightly longer and wider than the iPhone. It in turn makes an already large, hard-to-pocket iPhone 6 even harder to put in a pocket.<br /><br />Overall, this is a sleek, great looking folio case. I really like the simplicity design with a slot for a credit card and driver license (which are probably what you'll need to carry with you for most days), and that it can double up as a stand for easy viewing on a table. It also protects the large touchscreen well with its cover. It may not be truly pocketable, but it certainly protects the iPhone well.

10998	__label2__	5	Y	Office Products	1604180900	Carson Dellosa Colors Chart (114054)	Great Colors Chart - UNBEATABLE price!!	This is a great colors chart. Really good for toddlers still learning their colors & words.  Makes it very very clear what's going on - that the word you're using is the color, not the item itself (so when I say blue & point at the blue box he's not thinking the word for a butterfly is blue; of course then I say 'blue butterfly', which makes it even clearer - but for any little ones who don't know the names of all the color examples - this is great).  We have lots of 'colors' board books (the tiny ones & one regular one) - but I really don't like the layout or presentation of the whole color concept in those.  This is so much clearer - and all in one place - so they can see all these colors next to each other & understand the idea of colors.<br /><br />The only improvement it could have is lamination - if it was laminated - well that woudl be perfect.  But for the price I paid (2.50 right now, not an add on & free amazon shipping...you can't beat that!), it definitely deserves 5 stars.
10999	__label2__	4	N	Office Products	B001BLVGGY	Scotch® Heat Free Laminating System LS960	Nice Laminator for average usage	The Scotch Heat Free Laminating System does a pretty good job. I like that it IS heat free. To be honest, my husband is better at using these things than I am--he has more patience, but he is pleased with the results and has used it several times. I could see this being useful for scrap-booking. It's portable, which is nice, as well. I think it's easy to use, especially for a novice like me. Would recommend this one.

11003	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B003FK3KDG	Transformed	CHRISTIAN NINJA FILM?	This film is high in camp value. The city is selling drugs to pre-teen kids in their community. Apparently the drugs are from the CIA who need money to fund secret wars, although this aspect is background to the street scene.<br /><br />Pastor Debra (Shirlee Knudson) is on a crusade to clean up the streets. With well choreographed moves we haven't seen since Pamela Grier and Teresa Graves braved them, she becomes a focal point for laughter. She is aided by the mysterious &#34;Fist&#34; (Leo Fong) who can stealthy moved through the city unnoticed due his slow motion swagger music and Father Guido Sarducci disguise. Fred Williamson helps out later as soon as his gig in the Philippines (camp martial arts movie capital) is completed.<br /><br />The film is packed with plenty of unintentional laughs as a martial arts drug dealing film is toned down to a &#34;Christian&#34; message movie. And just when you think the acting can't get any worse stunt man Ken Moreno appears on the screen reading lines.<br /><br />Parental Guide: No F-bombs, sex, or nudity.
11004	__label2__	4	N	Kitchen	B00LSI2010	Paderno World Cuisine Carrot Mincer	Well constructed specialty kitchen gadget	This seemed like a strange little kitchen gadget, but as one that appreciates and enjoys strange little kitchen gadgets, I was intrigued.<br /><br />If you're a minimalist in the kitchen, this mincer is really not for you. It's a specialty item, for sure, and if your kitchen is cramped and small, without a lot of room for different gadgets, this probably isn't for you. That being said, it has a small profile and is easily tucked away.<br /><br />I was impressed with how sturdy this item was. Putting it together was pretty intuitive, though I did check the directions once or twice. We have solid surface granite countertops, and I was pleased with how well the suction adhered. This little gadget wasn't going anywhere while I was mincing.<br /><br />Unlike the picture, you can't stick an entire carrot in the mincer and expect it to mince. (That's the only reason I knocked off a star - I feel like the picture is misleading). This thing is dependent on your strength to mince--it's not a powered item--so you have to work pretty hard to get it to mince even large pieces of carrot. It works best when you cut items into smaller pieces. And despite the fact that it's advertised as a carrot mincer, you can mince other items in here as well. I'd stick to veggies, generally.

It works great. The handle is just long enough to hook on above the slot, the lowered side allows the mail to drop in (even magazines) and my two dogs --get nothing. Its a sturdy well made basket and can withstand two very enthusiastic dogs leaping at it day after day. I'm sure it would be great on a bike too!

I am 5'8&#34; and my husband is 6'3&#34; so this is sweet!  For $132.77 this rocks.  I'd even have paid the full price of $159.95.  I am NOT a fan of top loading backpacks but this has nice side access zippers to get at the stuff that is packed down at at the bottom, so best of both worlds.  The adjustability of the back support is nice and easily used.  Being able to continually adjust the back/torso fit straps really does lead to all day trail comfort, they really nailed it.  Even nicer is the adjustability of the front chest straps, something I wish my old Kelty had.  The pockets on the waist belt are really handy, we liked those a lot.  We are not likely to use the hydration system capability though but it is nice to have that as an option, my husband in his younger years did used to se a camelback, so he is happy to have the ability.  All the cinch straps and adjustments and pockets and all, it just seems really well thought out and designed, we are impressed.

After reading dozens of reviews about each of the electric shavers under $100 (and some over) I decided to give this one a chance. Now, after two weeks of use, I'm ready to report in.<br /><br />As someone with sensitive skin, I was excited to see how this would work. The head has a switch on the side which locks the blade or allows it move as you shaving.<br /><br />Pros<br /><br />Locked or unlocked mode is great for sensitive skin<br />Easy cleaning!<br />Battery life seems pretty good so far. I'll update if that changes over time<br />No issues of redness or difficulty adjusting at least for me.<br /><br />Cons<br /><br />The noise! I know people mentioned that it was loud, but this high pitched buzz is difficult to muffle in the morning<br /><br />For anyone looking to upgrade their electric razor, as I was, this was a great choice.<br /><br />Update 1/10/13: Battery life still seems to be holding up (couple of hours with each charge) and the razor is still cutting the same. I'm sure I will have to replace the blades soon, but for now they are still getting the job done. But that buzzing is still loud...

They can be soaked in water and sowed outdoors for accelerating the process. Germination rate may be poor, so a lot of seeds need to be sown.

11019	__label2__	5	N	Kitchen	B0030HRU26	Tea Beyond Heat resistant Glass Teapot Juliet, 20-Ounce	Gorgeous	I can't imagine a more wonderful, elegant teapot in the world. This has to be the prettiest darn teapot I've ever seen. Pictures don't do this any justice. The glass is a gorgeous delicate clear form, the most perfect dimensions in the world. The handle is a pale pink glass ribbon. The cover is capped with a delicate rose in the same light pink glass. The teapot is made of modern sturdy heatproof glass, but has the look of Depression glass. I am simply amazed at how elegant this is for such a reasonable price.<br /><br />The teapot is in fact dripless. Pouring a cup of tea is simple and there is never a stray drip of tea. The body is wide and low so it is easy to pour exactly the amount of tea you want. The teapot looks so delicate; I was concerned about pouring boiling water into it. That was a crazy thought; the teapot is designed for those hot temperatures and can withstand the thermal shock.<br /><br />The little cup inside is perfect for loose tea. There are a series of tiny slits in the bottom of that cup to allow water to flow through but keeps back the tealeaves. One of the first cups I brewed was with old tea that had a ton of fines. Very little got through the fine slits. What did get through settled to the bottom of the pot and never got into my teacup. That wide round shape also helps with fines settling.<br /><br />I absolutely adore this teapot. It is perfect for just over two cups of tea, contrary to it looking very small. This pot amazes me; it has all the feel of an antique.

In the remake of the movie "The Producers", when the Leo Bloom character quits, he turns in his green eyeshade and his Dixon Ticonderoga Number 2 pencil. Yes, these pencils are that good - good enough to be recognized in song by the lead character. And as good as their yellow painted pencils are, these black painted babies are so much better. Better erasers (soooo soft) and better finish (soooo not slippery). I have a bunch and keep them around, with extra sharp points to attack crossword puzzles, do some number crunching and, of course, finishing that all important doodle.  Yes, Faber-Castell makes $10 (not a typo) pencils WITHOUT erasers, and they are darn nice pencils. But for the price of a couple of those, you can get a year's supply of these and be just as happy.  If you use pencils or your kids use pencils, these are the ones to have. They may be the best pencils in the world!  Certainly, they are the very best value.
11021	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B008NM6VFU	Crescent DB16 16-Inch Adjustable Pry Bar, Nail Puller, Red/Black	Much more than a Nail Claw	I got the 16&#34; as suitable for a home-wrecker. The nail puller angles nicely and slips under the heads easily. Good angle for leverage. The jaws are aggressively shaped for good gripping during high torque. Good versatility and balance.  The build qualities tops for both durability and functional adjustability. The handle cushion makes for a more comfortable grip, gloved or ungloved, hence more power.  These are made for Crescent in Taiwan. The quality of my steel is quite good, which reminds me. There is also a handy striking face you can use in a pinch for a hammer -- not a big deal, but a nice touch of extra convenience.

The negative reviewers will have real problems trying to label these things false, they are not.  I had forgotten many of the things Mr. Bernstein brought up, as they seem to just disappear under the rug.  In fairness, someone could probably do the same thing using accurate reporting on Republican faux pas, but I sincerely doubt they would be as egregious.
11024	__label2__	2	N	Toys	B007AIL1A8	Fashion Angels Wrist Twists Bracelet Maker	A bit more complicated than necessary	My daughter (8.5 years old) and I had high expectations of this kit as we love doing crafts and thought this would be a fun project to work on together. Unfortunately, after trying it out, I am in agreement with some of the other negative reviews here. The instructions were a little more complicated than I expected and certainly not very child-friendly, which means adults would have to get involved in order to get a child going on this project. The DVD was OK but I would not say it was very helpful either.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed by the loom and some of the bracelets we were working on came undone easily which saw us resorting to working on them by hand, a tedious process that left me and my daughter feeling like it was all a bit too much work and not much fun. The plus side is that the satin cords are colorful and feel nice but ultimately there are better bracelet making kits out there such as the [[ASIN:B007ON3D7I Braidzilla Bracelet Braiding Kit]].
11025	__label2__	4	N	Books	0062190458	Queen of the Dark Things: A Novel	A nice read if you read the first book for the backstory.	I'm a huge fan of fantasy, so I really enjoyed this book. I thought that the character development was pretty good and the story was interesting. It did get a little hard to follow in places and you really need to read book one before you read this book in order to get the back story. If you read the first book first, then the second book is better. But trying to read the second book without reading the first gives the book a bit of a disjointed plot.<br /><br />I recommend reading the first book before reading this one. I liked it enough that I will be reading the 3rd book in the series.

I'm *that* much of a banana bread lover!  This White Post Farm banana bread is the stuff I've always admired the most, but I'm particularly fond of the homemade stuff too.  Seriously, an Amish store downtown was selling several loaves of banana bread in a giant bin.  I noticed them the moment I walked inside.  I nearly cried with excitement... and cried more when I came back a few weeks later and they were all gone. Banana bread is my best and only friend.  It just goes down my throat so well.

It thought it was pretty good myself.<br /><br />Cooking was easy.  I just had to boil water.  The box said cook it for seven minutes.  I did it, and it was a little hard.  I cooked it some more for two more minutes and it was better that way.<br /><br />I like that the light color of the pasta and the fact that it doesn't stick.  I didn't tell anyone this is gluten free and no one noticed.  Asked how they liked it, my family gave it a thumbs up.
11029	__label2__	5	Y	Camera	B005NX7HY6	Sony 50mm f/1.8 Mid-Range Lens for Sony E Mount Nex Cameras	Great for portraits and low light shots when a zoom is just too slow	I am a long time fan of Sony NEX cameras, and I have owned and used many of the Sony brand E-mount lenses available for the NEX cameras, including the Sony SEL16F28 16mm f/2.8 Wide-Angle, the SEL1855 E-mount 18-55mm F3.5-5.6 OSS, and the SEL55210 55-210mm f/4.5-6.3. All those lenses have produced great pictures, especially when using RAW output corrected for distortion and chromatic aberrations through software such as Adobe Camera Raw and Lightroom. When using the JPG mode the more recent NEX cameras, such as the NEX-5N and NEX-7, will, if the firmware has been updated, make a lot of those same corrections internally and automatically apply the corrections to the saved JPG images.<br /><br />The only draw back to the zoom lenses of course is that they are slow. Still, for low light level work, the use of a so-so slow lens with vibration stabilization will usually beat an optically  much better fast lens that does not support stabilization. So I was interested to try the Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8 for low light work. The extra lens speed allows for the use of a lower ISO, and the net gain in image qaulity is worth the cost to use of a fast lens.<br /><br />The lens has been great for work in low light, and the focal length has been perfect for close-ups of architectural details and art objects. If a photographer shoots in RAW, and uses Adobe Camera RAW or Lightroom to correct for lens distortions via software lens profiles, and to correct for chromatic aberration, or if the photographer shoots in JPG and uses the NEX camera's internal software corrections, then the few weak points of the lens are effectively canceled out. I have been very happy with my Sony SEL50F18 50mm f/1.8, and plan to use it often on my next project. RECOMMENDED.
11030	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B008S8WA18	MSI LGA1155/Intel B75/DDR3/SATA3 USB 3.0/A&GbE/MicroATX Motherboard B75MA-P45	A budget board that packs a punch!	I purchased this board as a backup for my MSI Z77MA-G45 that I had to RMA, but also to serve as the motherboard in my test rig. This board has many things going for it, several of which I will list:<br /><br />1) It is well made, and despite being MSI's budget motherboard, it compares nicely to boards in the $100+ category.<br />2) It has four memory slots for a maximum of 32GB of RAM, not bad for a low-end board at all!<br />3) It has USB 3.0 ports, something missing from many of its competitors, and even has headers for two more!<br />4) It has a SATA3 port for getting the most of an OS SSD.<br />5) It has one each of PCIEx16, PCIEx1 and PCI, meaning you won't have to upgrade an old PCI card if you don't want to.<br />6) It is compatible with OSX with little to no modification.<br /><br />I was first drawn to MSI's motherboards after reading an article about hackintosh-compatible mATX motherboards. MSI boards, it seems, are just as easy to use as Gigabyte, and in my opinion are MUCH better looking. MSI has done a great job with the color scheme, which is understated without being too muted. With several power saving options, this is a great HTPC/general home use motherboard but don't let that put you off! It supports RAM up to 2400mhz and will play nicely with even the Core i7 processors!<br /><br />Now, I really want to take a second and mention MSI's UEFI BIOS. This thing is amazing, and if you haven'te experienced UEFI BIOS's yet, you're in for a treat. The thing looks great, has intuitive controls, and heck, you can even use your mouse! The BIOS has three settings: power saving, normal and overclocked. It has automatic overclocking (apparently going off of your components automagically) or you can overclock manually. I'm not an overclocker so I can't really comment, but I saw controls for changing clock speeds and voltages for both the CPU and the RAM, as well as various other settings which I'm sure others will find much more useful than I did!<br /><br />I tried to think of some drawbacks to this motherboard, but with USB 3.0 support and four slots of DDR3, the only minor complaint I have is that there is only one SATA3 port. Still, you can have your OS drive on the one avaialble, and the only reason I would want a second is for my test rig. Barr any possible issues like I had with my Z77MA (power cycle loop) I highly recommend this as a VERY attractive 1155 mATX board. I don't think you'll regret choosing this budget board!

11032	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B00B8KJH0U	Monster Mobile Talk In-Ear Headphones, Cobalt Blue	Bright Blue Without the Blues	These Monster In-Ear Headphones are my first Monster product that is not a cable. Monster has taken the headphone market by storm and grabbed a huge market share. Why? Is it because they are really good or is it because they are experts on marketing their products? Don't know but it's probably both.<br /><br /> These bright cobalt blue ear-buds have a very good sound. The treble is sweet and high without being tinny. The base is surprisingly good for ear-buds and it doesn't sound muddy. The mids fill in the middle well. The overall sound is crisp without being harsh, smooth without being muddy.<br /><br />The cable is 50 inches long.<br /><br />The packaging looks great if you are giving them as a gift.<br /><br />Lightweight so not to pull out of the ear easily.<br /><br />Three sizes of lite rubber ear cups are provided so they should fit just about anyone.<br /><br />Comes with a small velcro tie for keeping the cable wrapped up and a lapel clip.<br /><br />The ear-buds are magnetized on the back so you can stick the two ends together.<br /><br />For the price it would have been nice to have a case included.<br /><br />Well constructed with a solid feel.<br /><br />The jack turns at a 45 degree angle.<br /><br />Can be used for cell phone use with built-in mic. (I do not use this controller)<br /><br />The cable is flat instead of the usual round which seems to not tangle as easily.<br /><br />Overall these are a great sounding pair of ear-buds. Although pricier then many products out there they are way cheaper then high-esr in-the-ear phones. I think you'll be pleased with them.<br /><br />NOTE: IF YOU WANT THE BEST SOUND OUT OF ANY EAR-BUDS, IF YOU ARE USING A SMART PHONE OR TABLET, DOWNLOAD A GOOD EQUALIZER APP. THERE ARE MANY ON THE MARKET AND MOST OF THEM WILL BRING YOUR MUSIC TO A NEW LEVEL.

It is all about what you are into.<br /><br />A group of &#34;outsiders&#34; are hired by a circus, which is run by all deformed individuals and are called family. Lon (Christopher Adamson) is in charge, a man who has open sores oozing with pus. The outsiders come up with a plan to rob the circus by stealing the gate receipts. When it is discovered Lon has a ton of money including &#34;castles&#34; they opt for plan &#34;B&#34; where Lucy (Rebekah Kochan) the gang's girl comes onto Lon to the point he wants to marry her.<br /><br />The rest of the family is skeptic of Lucy, as well they should be.<br /><br />Without giving away any plot spoilers, I will dare to say there are bloody and graphic scenes. Outside of the midget, the deformities appear to be special effects. For example, the guy with no arms, clearly had arms under his shirt.<br /><br />I think if they had a metal soundtrack, this could have been an excellent grindhouse. As it was, it was just pretty disgusting. If you can make it through 6 &#34;Saw&#34; films and a couple of &#34;Human Centipedes&#34; this one should be a snap.<br /><br />F-bomb, sex, and nudity (Rebekah Kochan, Amanda Ward)
11035	__label2__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B00STSUPCS	Viva Labs TRIPLE STRENGTH Glucosamine, Chondroitin and MSM, GUARANTEED Joint Agony Relief, 240 Capsules	Glucosamine - Chondroitin - MSM	I've been using glucosamine and chondroitin since around 1990 and then added MSM back around 15 years ago. I had the beginnings of arthritis and other bone problems and way back then, this product was pretty new to the public and I did a lot of research on it, so I'll tell you what my experience has been from using it all of these years.    In general terms, what you're getting here is glucosamine to stimulate cartilage growth, and chondroitin to use for the growth itself. MSM is a chemical found in plants, animals, and humans and is an anti-inflammatory, or a weak version of NSAIDS like aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen.    I had help from a physician who specialized in sports medicine back when I started using this. He promoted the use of a concentrated liquid version because it was a more effective delivery system to the body. But his theory made sense to me and it has proved out through the years of me taking this. I'll relate the gist of it.    Every human body is different, but somewhere in your 20's the body starts growing cartilage less effectively and we can begin losing it faster than we regrow it. That's the reason to use this product.    Having back the cartilage that you had when you were younger, is almost universally beneficial. But it doesn't fix injuries and so many other problems. Between my two knees, I've had surgery five times and the doc said that I had good cartilage, which allowed him to cut a lot away while he repaired various tears and other things. A lack of cartilage is just one other problem of many.    Back to my sports doc, his theory on how to use this made sense to me, and this is what he said.    Take a double dose of this for 30-40 days and you should get some fast regrowth and then be able to switch to the normal dose. About this same time, you should be feeling the benefits of having the new growth. If you feel no benefits, it's likely that a lack of of cartilage wasn't the problem that you suffered from in the first place, many don't.    If you're happy with the results, you'll want to continue and grow as much back as possible, but at a point, you won't be anymore and using this product doesn't help, except to replace further loss. I've found that a half dose will maintain and regenerate my own losses, but this would be different for each individual. But you might want to experiment with this to reduce the daily cost of taking it. Taking other supplements like I do, would probably affect this also.    As for this particular product? Only someone just starting out with this one, and taking it for 40-60 days could even have a valid comment on it's effectiveness, not me. This is why I'm telling you of my experience, because you'll have to try it for yourself to see. I'm not loyal to any brand and the additives like MSM are fine, but not a big deal for someone who already takes anti-inflammatory medication. I've also had my knees shot full of hyaluronic acid, which you'll find in some of these. It's a natural lubricant made from rooster combs and it's done little for me, and taking it orally is questionable.     This is likely the 20th brand that I have used and it seems just like others that aren't from the big companies.The only reason for my 4 star rating, is because I like taking this supplement and have for many years, but I can't tell you how well this one works compared to another and I'm being honest about this, because I can't. Anybody telling you of the benefits from taking it just one week, well, I'd be skeptical of. That wasn't how it worked for me or others that I've talked with or my doc's understanding of using it.    Most of all, I hope that I've helped you to understand how and why this product can potentially help you. Try it to find out for yourself, and then you should decide whether or not it helps you, and even if it doesn't seem to help much today, whether or not you like the idea of it preventing future pain from the lack of cartilage.    Because if this is affordable for you, that may be it's biggest selling point in my own mind, you've got a lot of joints to take care of and this can only help them.    This product was provided for me to review.
11036	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B0000BZNDK	Broadway's Lost Treasures	You Can't Catch Live Theatre on Film Part I	Theatre is a living art form, and when a play is filmed as a play, it usually goes flat. That is no less true of these musical numbers, performed for the Tony Awards, than it is of anything else.<br /><br />The majority of these selections are ho-hum.  Carol Channing, Zero Mostel, Julie Andrews, Yul Brennar, John Raitt, Gwen Verdon, Chita Rivera, Ann Miller, and Mickey Rooney are great talents, but you wouldn't necessarily notice it from these numbers.  Robert Preston does a memorable "Trouble" from The Music Man, but I suspect him of lip-synching; Bonnie Franklin is interesting if only because she was incredibly thin when she did the title song for Applause.  The selection from Cats, especially Betty Buckley's "Memory," are very good--but I think everyone has seen them a hundred thousand times already.  But there are a few knock-outs.<br /><br />Patti LuPone is the ultimate Evita with two magnificent performances, "A New Argentina" and "What's New Buenos Aires."  Annie is not among my favorite musicals, but the performances remind me of why it was such a smash: Andrea McArdle, Dorothy Loundon, and Company really knock it out of the box.  Jerry Orbach is memorable in "Lullaby of Broadway" from 42nd Street, and there is a true rarity in Barbara Harris' magnificently comic "Movie Star Gorgeous" from the obscure The Apple Tree.  "Willkommen" from Cabaret and "Kickin' The Clouds Away" from My One and Only are also notable.  Even so, this out-of-print DVD has a ridiculous price, especially considering that most of these clips are available on the internet.  Save your bucks and see a live show.<br /><br />GFT, Amazon Reviewer
11037	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00H3SZ66U	Food Should Taste Good Multigrain Tortilla Chips Bag, 6 Ounce	FSTG Multigrain chips are very good	I buy these locally, but I wanted to post here and say how good I think these are. That, and mention that you may want to look for them at your local grocer or Target (or wherever you shop). I can get these at either Target or Safeway for between ~$3.50 and $5 for a 5.5-ounce bag depending on the day, and you can check the expiration date when you buy locally. Buying directly from Amazon is a good way to go, though, as I know that they'll make it right if you get a bad batch from them.  Prices fluctuate so much on Amazon, though, that you certainly may find them cheaper here than locally.  There are multiple product pages on Amazon for these chips, so be sure to check around for the best price and bag size for your needs.  If you're like me, you might find a 1-ounce bag to not be quite enough.  :)<br /><br />I really like the flavor, texture, and size of the Multigrain version (and it's the only one that I've tried, although I've seen some of the others). They have a nice, healthy taste to them - not overly salty or oily, and I love the addition of the seeds. Btw, the seeds aren't obtrusive or make them more difficult to eat. Instead, they just add some nice additional taste to the corn. Although not triangular like a lot of tortilla chips, the shape is still good for dipping into salsa.<br /><br />I enjoy these chips either with salsa or simply plain. They taste good, and while likely still not a health food :), they sure seem healthier to me than a lot of the regular corn tortilla chips that I get.<br /><br />Two big thumbs up from me for the Multigrain. I highly recommend them.

It is the strongest stuff I've ever smelled and after just one use, it was enough to make me not ever want to get near it again.  I'm not one of those reviewers who is going to lie because I got a free product.  It's just not going to happen.<br /><br />I am not saying this product doesn't work, hence the 3 stars.  However, in order to be able to use something to thoroughly provide testing, it would require you to be able to use it.  Because of the overpowering scent, I just could not use it.  So, if you can't use something because the smell is so heinous, it probably isn't going to be very effective no matter how awesome the product.
11039	__label2__	5	N	Books	0373893051	The Delight Gluten-Free Cookbook: 150 Delicious Recipes	Here's the recipes I tested and info on the special features in this cookbook. It's now a must-have for my gluten-free cooking!	With 2 members of the family who are gluten-free,  I'm always searching for new and innovative recipes. Whether you're experienced or are new to gluten-free cooking, this book would be among my top 3 choices - not only for the recipes ( you can check out the ones I tested and the results below) but some unique special features. There are instructions on how to prepare several special flour mixes.. There is also comprehensive information about many  other aspects of gluten-free living. This is an impressive resource.    A major asset of this book are the instructions for creating  3 special baking flour blends, each with special advantages. There is the Basic Gluten-Free All-Purpose Homemade Flour Blend. Then there is  a High- Protein and Fiber All Purpose flour blend as well as another option-  a High-Protein, Low -Glycemic Flour blend.     These special mixes do NOT appear on any store shelves and are only in this book.    Listed below are the results of a round of testing recipes and the results.  Below that is a section on the special features of this book. The author is an active member of the advisory board of the Celiac Disease Program at Children's National Medical Center as well as the executive editor of Delight Gluten-Free magazine.    I do think it is important to note that if you are following a low-calorie or low-fat diet, you will need to keep a CLOSE eye on the calorie and fat counts per serving. Many are high. Even so, I found that by making a few simple substitutions . I could  lower calories and fat to acceptable levels. However, the recipes I tested for this review have NOT been altered or tweaked from the original instructions.     Also, there are a fair number of recipes here that are reasonably low in calories. These include: Veggie Pizza, Crab and Oyster Mushroom Bisque, Gazpacho salad, Spiced Kale Chips, Stuffed Mushrooms (Lemon, Ricotta and Kale filling)    On to the recipes:    Here's what we made on Day 1: We started with Herbed Hummus, anice mixture of garbanzo beans, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, basil leaves, cilantro leaves, parsley, chives, and garlic. It was incredible, eaten on its own or served with gluten-free crackers. This is a recipe which is easily tweaked a bit so if you hate cilantro, as some do, add a bit more parsley or adjust to taste. We followed the recipe just as written. We devoured it within an hour.     Next on the agenda? Another appetizer, Baked Potato Chips with Parsley, Garlic and Sea Salt. This is an easy snack recipe to prepare and clean-up is minimal, especially if you have parchment paper on hand to line the baking sheets (as recommended by the author) These chips could also be a side dish with dinner. They had a nice depth of flavors, and the simple additions of garlic and parsley were just the right touches. You can modify this one easily to accommodate your favorite spices.     Moving on to dinner: we made Green Beans with Tomatoes, Garlic, and Onions. We had fresh green beans and tomatoes waiting to be used. It took less than 15 minutes to pull this one together (not counting time to remove the ends from the fresh green beans) . Fresh green beans, onions, garlic and a touch of red pepper flakes. Delish!    Then came Pan- Seared Chicken Cutlets with Mushroom Gravy. Took minutes to make and the gravy turned simple  chicken cutlets into a gourmet dish.    We wanted a simple dessert for the meal's finish so we went with the Flan de Coco, easily made with staple ingredients found in our refrigerator and pantry. Very satisfying.     We didn't have time to cook many breads except for quick breads. The Peach Yogurt Quick Bread was a smash hit - as were the Oatmeal Pancakes and the Buttermilk Cheddar Breakfast Biscuits. I'm particularly interested in seeing how the sandwich bread turns out and will update this review then. To be honest, by the time we got to breads  I was feeling too tired to tackle more.    Special features of this cookbook: In addition to the standardinfo about foods which contain gluten, there is an extensive list of gluten-free ingredients, safe food additives, unsafe foods,etc. The info on Food Labeling Laws in the United States was helpful for me as well as special tips on "Navigating the Grocery Store for Home Cooking" .

11042	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B00HA02Z7Y	kate spade new york Women's 1YRU0481 Gramercy Grand Gold Ion-Plated Watch	Very stylish and good quality, but on the heavy side	This is a very nice women's timepiece. It has a pleasing design and the popular 38mm size. The three small subdial windows show day of week, day of month and hour in 24h format. (The included user manual does not mention the last subdial mode. This particular model does not have a stopwatch function.) It looks stylish on any woman's wrist and is appropriate for most occasions. It's rated 3ATM which means it's safe to wear in showers or washing hands, but not for swimming - much like the new Apple Watch.<br /><br />The reason I give it 4 stars is it does feel heavy - heavier than similarly priced watches we've bought from Amazon over the last few years. The heft is enough to make it a little less than the perfect daily wear I think most would like. Some women probably don't mind, but the manufacturer should have shaved a little weight to make the watch more comfortable. The strap is high quality and easy to close and open.<br /><br />If heavy watches don't bother you, this would be a top choice in this price range.

11044	__label2__	5	N	Furniture	B00EPRCG10	DreamFoam Bedding 10-Inch Memory Foam Mattress, Full	Another Happy Customer!	This memory foam mattress came compressed in plastic with two pillows. We removed the plastic and let it expand on the box springs. In no time at all, it started expanding quickly. There was a faint odor that didn't last long at all. (I've had foam mattress tops that smelled much worse for a longer period of time.) It takes a little getting used to, but I can say with complete honesty that I slept better then I have in years! I went to bed with a slight backache and the mattress made it feel better. This is real quality and the pillows were an extra bonus. Both products are excellent.

AS someone who still craves the mac and cheese I got in the box as a kid, this is pretty close. I thought the salt level was about right - you can always add cheese or whatever you want to it.

We have one single pocket door and one double pocket door. Putting one on each side of the double door allows access from either side of the door, which is nice.<br />So far, the glue has held strong, and the locking feature (so that the door can be opened freely) is nice.<br />My only issue with them is that while unlocked, and opening the door, the fins ride along the inside of the pocket door and make a squealing noise. When closing the door, they don't make any noise, and if the lock is disabled, of course they make no noise. For now they deserve a full rating. We'll see how long they last.

Saved $4000 engine repair	This genuinely saved my family over $4000.<br />Car: 2003 Audi A6 3.0 Quattro.<br />Mileage: 85,000 miles.<br />Problem: Check engine lights for BOTH variable valve timing actuators sticking.  Condition present 75% of the time, so occasionally they would unstick.<br /><br />I put 1 quart of MMO into the oil.  I expected nothing, but for $10, why not.  Over the next 2000 miles, a miracle.  The check engine light for this problem would come on less and less until it stopped coming on at all.  The MMO cleaned and lubricated the heads (where the VVT actuators reside) enough to restore normal operation.<br /><br />I have never believed in a simple additive like I believe in Marvel Mystery Oil.  It is incredible.<br /><br />Update:<br />Now 2013, the Audi still has not had this problem come back.  Best fix ever.
11052	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00004WI5C	Blue's Clues - Blue's Big Musical Movie	An excellent film for little children, with a great Ray Charles moment	Both my daughters greatly loved this charming and sweet film in which Blue, Steve and all their friends are preparing a big musical show. Periwinkle and Side Table Drawer play particularly important roles, but all the gang is here: Mailbox, Mrs Salt, Mr Pepper, Paprika, Slippery Soap, Shovel, Pail, Tickety Tock, Magenta and even the Purple Kangaroo.<br /><br />A particularly great moment is the explanation of how to compose a song, made by G-Clef the Keyboard, who speaks and sings with voice of Ray Charles and by Notes, who are voices by the a capella group The Persuasions.<br /><br />There is humor, there is emotion and there is of course a very happy ending with a great singing finale. A wonderful film for little kids. Enjoy!

The package isn't resealable, meaning if you stick this in your bag, lint and dust and dirt will find it's way into it.  That said, I've found that taking a few out and putting them into a small zip lock baggie will keep them handy and lint free.<br /><br />For their use, they work very well and provide a quick method to cleaning your lens while on a shoot.

The knobs on the side are more of a gimmick though. I ride in hard pack sometimes and those knobs don't do a thing on corners. My average cycling speed is 6-8mph, but I have to slow way down on these tires otherwise I'll slide. I have this on my front and a Kenda K838 Slick Wire Bead on the back. Part of it could be my fault though, the times I've ridden on hard pack I was inflated for the road @ 60 psi. If I took it down to 50 psi I wouldn't be surprised if I got a little more grip.

Whether I am running my own PA that I am used to setting up and using or I am stepping into unfamiliar territory running someone else's PA system, I bring the crash bag. Who knows what someone will ask of the soundman... The point is to be prepared for as many eventualities as you possibly can without loading yourself down with too much antiquated stuff you will never use. The little Planet Waves Logo sticker came off, but other than that, these things are built to last, are not noisy and can be useful sometimes.

It almost makes you sick just how much more awesome this is than the already incredible PS-40 (older model of the same thing).  I have this in my work tool kit for one project, but I bought it because I have the PS-40 at home.  I couldn't believe how much smaller it is.  Not to mention even more lighting from the variable speed trigger (which I often use without even putting the motor into action) and the battery level indicator.  And more torque!  It's just amazing.  I have the PS-40, the 12v drill with chuck (same generation) and a big Bosch hammer drill at home, and the poor hammer drill barely gets to do anything anymore except drilling into masonry, because the PS-40 drives everything so smoothly (even into masonry) that I just can't believe it.  The duo is just incredible, being able to drill then drive without bit changes or anything else.  And the power you feel from this small device always amazes...  I guess the reason it makes me sick is because I love my personal PS-40 so much that I'd never retire it early, but then I get to use the even better PS-41 on occasion, and I want to have that too!

In addition, it has an adjustable stem so that it can be customized for people of different heights.  The plastic cutter strings are extended not by bumping the machine on the ground but by hitting a switch on the side of the machine.  I bumped the machine on the ground several times before convincing myself to use the switch to extend the string.<br /><br />This is a good trimmer that offers excellent performance; however, it may not be the trimmer I use personally because it is heavier than my old trimmer.  I am much smaller than the average American, and adding extra weight to the trimmer means, for me, that the machine is more difficult to control and that I tire much more quickly when using the trimmer.<br /><br />For small folk, this may not be the trimmer you want.  For everyone else, however, you'll be pleased with the machine and with your results.<br /><br />Four Stars!

11062	__label2__	3	N	Toys	B00CW5M6EE	K'NEX Extreme Sports Building Set	Extremely K'nex	I love the Knex toys.  You can build the specific items on the box, of course, but then they easily come apart and it is fun to make new things out of them.  There is a lot of room for imaginative play with these.  I have always been a diehard fan of Legos but K'nex brings something new into the mix - the ability to make larger items that are more fluid and recognizable.<br /><br />I liked the figures doing different sports.  These can all be constructed fairly quickly just from the exploded diagrams, however, they can't be set up at the same time.  There is only one helmet.<br /><br />Some of the pieces, like the front of the surfboard and the jet ski are things I haven't seen before.<br /><br />This is a great kit of 258 pieces.  The colors are, as always, bright and varied.  I was kind of surprised how small they look but they are giant and pointy when you step on them in the dark.

11067	__label2__	4	N	Kitchen	B00KH9PWPC	New Star Foodservice 42849 Enameled Aluminum Lime Squeezer, Green	good basic lime juicer	An attractive lime squeezer. It fits normal-sized supermarket limes (cut in half), but might struggle with the extra-large persian limes available at peak season. It's too small to handle lemons.    This tool is not nearly as substantial as my Oxo Lemon/Lime squeezer. I prefer that larger Oxo squeezer for juicing many limes (necessary when the limes are dry, or for margaritas). The Oxo can also handle lemons easily.    In case you haven't used this kind of squeezer (previous to my Oxo, I used a reamer), it takes far less effort than reaming, and keeps the acidic juice off your skin.    The green color of this squeezer is a nice way to make it obvious what this tool is for, and the small size is a benefit for space-constrained kitchens. Recommended for lightweight lime juicing.

It would just as stated and does everything it promises, it feels solid and built well. I like the removable keyboard feature, I don't like it slightly more bulky and heavy. The whole point of getting the iPad air was to feel the lightness and thinness product but you can't really tell the difference between the 4 and the air with this Keyfolio keyboard. Overall, good product, just wish they would figure out a way to make it slimmer/lighter/compact.
11071	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00KB9OPB0	Rescue Yellow Jacket Attractant Cartridge (5)	Great product!	Very good attractant and I have successfully used it for many (~10) years. Great price here, and convenient, unless you are at Home Depot anyway, and nice it is delivered free with Prime. It smells like dead fish so keep it away from the patio or an open window, if possible, and load it in a closed garage with gloves on. After I use this I squirt a single pack into it, as it makes it last the season; saves money, is easy, and is much better than the old cotton balls they used. I do not recommend the W. H. Y. type; only live bait attracts hornets and yellow jackets do not like, or escape from the WHY traps. I recommend this and the original Rescue yellow container, will buy this refill and the others again every year, and I hope this helps someone not get stung, prevent a home invasion, or to eat on the patio in peace.

There is no hardware included, you will need to supply your own.<br /><br />I would not use this if you expect any real strain on the cleat.  The ears will snap off under meaningful pressure.
11074	__label2__	3	N	Luggage	B00OTRE5FQ	Solo Executive 15.6" Laptop Backpack, Khaki, VTA730-11	Nice bag for school, but not a bag I could see an Executive using.	It's okay. Here's why. Although it offers a lot of roomy pockets, it really only works as a day/work backpack whereas I was hoping it could be used for short trips.<br /><br />The design is very linear. The back zipper portion would fit a fairly large laptop easily. The middle zipper section is really only good for long and tall things - books, documents, folders. You cannot comfortably fit clothes or weekend wear without the bag becoming really bulky just via its design.<br /><br />Front zipper pocket provides a space that is highly organized and then there are two larger just buttoned pockets that would be great for a book or notepad.<br /><br />Overall, I liked this bag for its functionality but wish it was a little more travel friendly. I also would go with a different color than khaki if the choice, khaki is exactly as it appears in the photo which really looks a lot more like military camo green.<br /><br />Nice bag for a college student, but not a bag I could see an Executive using.

I have used it already on a handful occasions, saving me from having to play outlet ping pong with big AC  housing plugs and a USB wall wart.<br /><br />The USB output has a 4.2A ceiling, meaning one or two USB ports in use will give approx. 2.1A, whereas 3 or 4 simultaneous used ports will give 1A each.  US plugs fit in there nice and secure with plenty of space for even the humongous AC plugs (that in itself is a major attraction).<br /><br />This probably won't take any major abuse, such as knocking around a gnarly toolbox or nasty construction areas, yet for me more staid circumstances, giving me direct power for powering laptops/ and USB devices, this is does what exactly I have been wanting. Don't need the multi-plug aspect, but it takes the two prong/three prong US plugs with a secure fit.<br /><br />The head snaps up, but it takes not only some tight wrapping, but a smidgen of tugging to get it to snap into the holder. Just another 1/4&#34; would have been perfect without the minor struggle, yet I leave that as feedback to the manufacturer - because I am otherwise supremely happy with this new power source tool.<br /><br />- Complimentary product provided for evaluation
11076	__label2__	2	Y	Camera	B002C1VF54	CowboyStudio Hand Painted 10' X 20' Blue Purple Muslin Photography Background	Sub Par Background Has Many Flaws	I'll caveat this review by saying I'm a fan of CowboyStudio. I use their lighting, backdrop frames and have a few of their muslin backdrops including a green screen all of which are excellent products.<br /><br />This particular backdrop was unfortunately a huge disappointment. I know enough to at least<br />understand that a really good, thick top quality muslin background, be it painted or not can set you back upwards of 300 clams.<br /><br />So I try to keep my expectations reasonable when ordering a background at this price point. However, I feel at any price this particular background will disappoint.<br /><br />* Uneven color and terrible dye bleeds cause shadows<br /><br />* The single most wrinkled background I've ever seen. Expect to spend a good hour steaming them out.<br /><br />* Poor quality stitching, means easy rips and tears<br /><br />* Extremely thin Muslin means a myriad of problems with lighting<br /><br />In my opinion this is a terrible choice, especially for the novice or intermediate, I consider myself in the latter category. That said, if you're looking for a decent background with color, and at this price point  there are plenty to choose from.<br /><br />Cowboy Studio has many fine products however this particular background isn't one of them.

Requires round outlets with single center faceplate screw.  Not for Decora.	This outlet works very well.  You have to remove the faceplate from the outlet and this plugs into both three prong outlets.  You must have a round outlet with a single facescrew in the center, not a decora outlet.  The screw from this screws into your outlet making it all very tight to the wall.  This particular version is tan, not the much more modern white.<br /><br />It seems to operate fine.  It hasn't &#34;tripped&#34; or anything.  I have my desktop computer and associated electronics plugged into this.

Touch them and you'll scream fake.<br />So the trick is to mount them where they cannot be touched.<br /><br />Now I checked the price for a real one to go with my real system: $140...

11083	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B00ND1KHY2	Mackie Mix Series Mix12FX 12-Channel Effects Mixer	Cheesy power supply but good overall value	I've owned several Mackie mixers going back a good many years to when they were all made in the U.S., and were the standard for compact, high quality boards; I still have a 4-channel Mackie USB mixer I use for doing basic recording on my Mac. The old ones were real pro gear that could stand up to the rigors of gigging. I don't think the newer made in China boards are of the same quality, but they're certainly good enough for light gigging and more than sturdy enough for home recording.  This particular mixer has four mic preamps, four stereo line inputs, and enough sends and returns to set up a flexible PA or a good basic home recording studio. The mic preamps sound okay to my ears, noise levels are low, and the controls are quiet. Yes, it has a cheesy power supply (this can be replaced) and the outputs pop who you plug it in (what were they thinking??) but this can be dealt with in a PA or studio setting by turning on the power amp(s) or monitors *after* you turn on the board. The multiple effects consist of several reverbs and echoes and a few phaser/flanger effects useful for recording and less so for live sound. The quality is about what you'd expect from a guitar pedal, and you could probably do better with the effects in your recording software (which would have the added advantage of being reversible.)  While there are a number of annoyances,makeup in mind that with all the functionality available, this board costs less than a decent microphone, and for that reason alone it's a very good choice for a band or soloist or home recorder starting out. At the asking price, I think it's a very good value, too.

11085	__label2__	4	N	Beauty	B00ON1VGZK	Benzac Blemish Clearing Hydrator, 1 Ounce	Might Be the Solution to Your/Your Child's Blemishes ...	As with most blemish fighting products, do expect a little dryness and maybe (if overused) some very minor peeling. And, as is customary, do try to begin using it every other day (or even every third day if your skin is already a little dry) and then increase the frequency of use incrementally. While there is a smell that might seem slightly off-putting, the results more than compensate for any initial discomfort. On the positive side, it leave skin soft and touchable.    Now, it is a little pricy. But, if less expensive products have seemed to fail, this might be a great moderately price system.    Like all similar lines, try it. Commit to it for about six-months. If you or your child does not see a noticeable difference, experiment with a different system or consult your physician.
11086	__label2__	5	N	Lawn and Garden	B00TKLZ9OM	Classic Accessories 55-399-030401-EC Ravenna Cover for Built-In Grills, Medium, Black	The Classic is a very well-made barbecue cover that won’t fly off in a gust of wind ...	One of the problems that we have in this area are high winds that often send everything from toys to an odd assortment of covers flying.  One year I ended up with some sort of tarp that we ended up using for our barbecue because no one claimed it.  The Classic cover is going nowhere fast and has a lot of great qualities that make it worth while for anyone with a built-in barbecue to invest in.  We don’t have a built-in, but still can use the cover.<br /><br />What’s great about it are the two Velcro straps beneath the cover that will secure it to the barbecue.  Along the edges the material is elasticized, another factor that will keep it from flying away.  If it does, the barbecue will have to go with it because it’s that secure.  The cover itself is a thick, sturdy 100% woven polyester with a rubberized lining.  This is the type of polyester that I see in backpacks an luggage.<br /><br />There are even some gussets with small circles that will help keep the Classic cover in place when there are heavy gusts of wind.  We do have those and that’s when we sometimes find an odd assortment of things in our yard.  The gussets will divert those gusts, keeping them from pulling the cover up into the air.  The cover will not only protect the barbecue from the elements, but make it easier to clean.<br /><br />The cover is water-resistant and very well-sewn and designed.  Installation, if you want to call it that, only takes a minute and is intuitive.  This is nothing like those cheap, lightweight tarps that blow away, tear, or get holes in them quickly.  It would take a long time to get any wear on this tarp from putting it on and off.  This is definitely a sturdy, well-made tarp that will protect a barbecue.

We have been looking for a new 2-line capable phone for a few months and, after a lot of research, picked this set since it more than met my needs. Here are my observations:<br /><br />+ Features We Use; 2-Line Capable, Built-In-Answering System, Intercom Functionality, Caller-ID, all of which work well<br />+ Range; Far exceeds my old system, covering all of our fairly large building<br />+ Bluetooth; great for using wireless headsets (not included) and pairing with your smart phone<br /><br />I like the design of the Base Station and have had no difficulty navigating the menu options when needed. The handsets are well made and allow for speaker phone use or connecting a wired headset. The battery life great, which is very important to us since the phones seem to get left the charger overnight more often than not.<br /><br />Overall, I am very pleased with this system in every way!<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

I bought both these Piyo Piyo nail scissors and a pair of Safety First nail clippers. The scissors are SO MUCH easier to use. As a first time mom, I was so nervous each time I cut my baby's tiny little nails. These scissors are very precise and sharp enough that you don't have to &#34;saw&#34; at the nail. Very safe way to trim a baby's nails. I haven't clipped her skin once using these.

I saw this one and thought I would give it try. Works fantastic. Its actually made of a softer silicone like material that seems to stay on and grab the camera case better than the GoPro brand one I have for my Hero3. Those seem to come off pretty easy. Plus hey, Its orange. Easy to see if you drop it.

11097	__label2__	3	N	Books	0062284576	The House on the Cliff: A Novel	Okay, not great, read.	What really drew me to this novel was the advertised gothic atmosphere and psychological suspense. What kept me from enjoying it was the main character, Jessica. She isn't exactly the best therapist and it really shows on every page. The pacing is good, the story is interesting, albeit with a lot of different elements thrown in to make it seem more &#34;gothic.&#34; It just felt too forced for me in the end.
11098	__label2__	2	N	Beauty	B007RTR9G0	Clear Nourishing Scalp & Hair Oil Therapy, Ultra Shea 3.0 oz	Not For Us	This "Scalp & Hair Oil" was a huge disappointment for my daughter and son, both having long dry hair that would normally benefit from a "nourishing" product. Sadly, the large amount of mineral oil in it just lays in the hair and makes it look flat and unwashed. There may be benefits from using the other oils, like the shea and argan, but they are out weighed by the negatives of the mineral oil.<br /><br />The only good side that we found was using it on "split ends" as it does seem helpful in reducing the fuzzy appearance, but it needs to be applied carefully and the excess removed quickly.<br /><br />We will not be using this in the future.<br /><br />CFH

I am a coffee fanatic and typically love it in just about any form it comes in, so it sin't surprising that this tastes good to me.<br /><br />This is instant coffee with the flavor creamer already added so it is very easy to make. The directions call for 2-tbsp of coffee per cup but I use just a little bit more and that seems to work best for my tastes.<br /><br />The coffee is very sweet, which is the only real draw back since it can't be scaled back for individual preferences<br /><br />Recommended!<br /><br />CFH

I think this is a good thing<br /><br />I am use to dry exfoliation, but this says to use it during your bath or shower (wet).  Well, it certainly works well following their directions.  This really helped remove the dead layer of skin and when I was done, my skin was almost baby soft.<br /><br />Is am very happy with this glove and I am buying another one for a friend.
11102	__label2__	3	Y	Furniture	B003ZIX9V6	Oriental Furniture 23" Natural Fiber Chest of Drawers on Wheels - Black	Almost but not quite	This is a sweet little end table, with little being the operative word.  The overall height is less than 23” from the floor to the top of the rail.  From the floor to the flat surface is 18-1/2”.  I foolishly thought the height measurement listed referred to the flat surface rather than the rail.  It is really too short to be a nightstand or end table.  I bought it for inside a closet for my Mother use for her socks & stuff when she comes each year for an extended visit, thinking we could then remove her suitcase from the room to give her more space.  But this little guy is so low to the ground she will have to stand on her head to access the drawers.  I’m going to try to find something to set it on, to make it easier for her to use.  That said, it is well made, lightweight, the black paint has been evenly applied, the drawers have a thin cloth lining, and it arrived well packaged and in perfect condition.  The swivel wheels on the one I received do not lock, so one has to hold the stand in place with one hand while opening drawers with the other.  This will be a 5-star purchase if you have need of something very small that rolls around, but it is certainly not ideal as a side table or for easy-use drawers.
11103	__label2__	5	N	Camera	B00SUY8DF2	FRiEQ® Waterproof Camera Float (2-Pack) - Floating Camera Wrist Strap for Your Underwater Camera - Compatible with GoPro, Panasonic Lumix, Nikon COOLPIX AW110, Canon PowerShot D20, Fujifilm FinePix, Olympus Tough, Marine Binoculars, Camcorders and Other Multiple Small Waterproof Devices	FRiEQ Buoyant Wrist Strap - 2 pack - Bright yellow - Great for waterproof cameras - Works well - Recommended	This buoyant wrist strap from FRiEQ works perfectly to bring your dropped item to the surface of the water, if that is what you seek. The strap is lightweight and comfortable to wear, while being very positively buoyant. If you seek such a strap, I would recommend this one.    We recently received a video camera from SJCam that has a waterproof shell, and have been playing with it in our fish tank and out in the snow (which we have had plenty of these last few weeks). With its waterproof case on, the camera weighs a few ounces so I hooked up this strap to it for our testing... and it went right on up to the top of the tank when let go.    Not too much more to say -- affordable, effective, comfortable and nice looking straps.    As far as hooking this up directly to the camera case (either at a strap port or via a hinge)... it is very easy: make sure that you look closely at the plastic connector on the loop, as this connector allows you to disconnect the loop from the strap. Disconnect it, loop the loop through port or hinge on your camera or device, and then connect the straps back to the loop. Very easy. It seems like some may have missed this, and tried instead to push the straps through the loop...    Neither the Amazon sales page or the retail packaging provides information on a warranty, so if an issue occurs I will return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive these straps gratis from the seller and put them to use in our fish tank to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.    If you are looking for a high quality pair of highly visible floating wrists straps of this construction, size, style and price, for use as I have noted above, them we would recommend giving these wrist straps from FRiEQ a try based and our experience with them.    Recommended.    Go for it.

I have 4 cats and 5 litter boxes so I do a lot of scooping. This scoop does not pick up easy and the sides of the scoop are not deep enough. I would not purchase this again.
11107	__label2__	4	N	Camera	B0010H3NKG	Delta 1 Precision 6'' Darkroom Thermometer	Decent for chemical prep.	An essential part of every darkroom, this thermometer is a well made little tool that according to my wife's digital kitchen thermometer reads quite accurately. You don't necessarily need to buy a "darkroom" thermometer seeing as 99% of the time you will be measuring temperatures with the lights on once the film is in your canisters and you are mixing your solutions, but Delta 1 has a great reputation in the photographic community.<br /><br />The only pitfall (and the reason I didn't give the full five stars) is that 6" is a tad short for a thermometer, especially since many people use taller bottles for solution prep.<br /><br />A good, cost-effective purchase, and definitely recommended!

11110	__label2__	5	N	Pet Products	B00HPZEKCM	Hill's Ideal Balance Adult Hairball Natural Chicken & Barley Recipe Dry Cat Food, 3.5 lb bag	We Call Them Peeblers	This is our young Maine Coon's favorite food. Okay, she likes snacks, and eats odd things like potato chips and green onion stalks. But when it comes to her primary diet, Hill's Ideal Balance Hairball Natural Chicken & Oats Recipe is her absolute favorite. For some reason, we've nicknamed them &#34;Peeblers&#34;. Believe it or not, she likes it more than canned food. I can't be more happy that we found a healthy food she enjoys, that helps keep the inevitable hairballs to a minimum. I know that this intended for adult cats, but don't tell her that!<br /><br />We have two older cats that like it, but not as much as she does. They'd rather have soft canned food, but won't turn their noses up if it is in the bowl. So as dry food goes, it gets high marks. The bag with a velcro closure is a nice touch as well. I just wish it wasn't quite so pricy.<br /><br />~ Kort
11111	__label2__	4	Y	Furniture	B002OL2FXI	Baxton Studio Callidora Brown Leather Sectional Sofa with Right Facing Chaise	So far it's OK	I have only had it for a month or so, so this review is pre-mature.The appearance is nice because it is a matte (not shiny) texture, and looks sleek. Fits well in my family room. In addition, the seat feel is firm and comfortable, it is not a soggy feel. I would say comfortable. Shipping was OK, a lot of wrapping/cardboard to remove of course. I had some issues with difficulty peeling a protective tape from the shiny feet, in fact I was not able to get all of it off but it looks fine now. Kind of expensive but I think it's probably a fair price for a large leather sofa. time will tell-  I will update this review if I have any problems with the sofa.
11112	__label2__	4	Y	Shoes	B002VEUWDI	Dockers Men's Caper Slip-On,Black,9.5 M US	Heavy shoe, but pretty good value overall.	I have a pair of Ecco Helsinki shoes as my primary dress shoe, but I wanted a cheaper black pair that I could wear on some days.  I’m typically wary of buying shoes from brands that aren’t primarily shoe makers, but I checked out these Dockers shoes based on the price and design.<br /><br />I like the casual design of the shoe, though my wife thinks they look cheap.  I like the tumbled leather look.  The rubber sole on this shoe is very thick and heavy, and it’s the heaviest slip-on shoe I’ve ever worn.  Because of this, I wouldn’t buy this shoe if you walk a lot in them.  I mostly sit in my office chair with these, so the heavy weight is not a big deal.<br /><br />They mostly run true to size- perhaps just running slightly large.<br /><br />Overall, you can’t expect too much from a shoe in this price range, but I’m happy with the purchase.

11115	__label2__	4	N	Home	B00CN0BJKU	AllerEase Bed Bug Allergy Protection Zippered Mattress Protector	Keep Your Mattress/Box Spring Clean & Protected	I am using this protector on a guest room bed.  This is not a luxurious cover; the top is polyester with vinyl backing under the fabric & vinyl side walls.  It is challenging to get this on your mattress so I use a washable mattress pad over it & just consider this cover part of the mattress.  It is waterproof so if you have bed-wetters, etc. , this will provide protection.<br /><br />It is machine washable but I would hang it to dry so you don't damage the vinyl. I think it would be a good idea to use a High Efficiency (h*e) washing machine to prevent damage to the vinyl.  The agitator on a traditional machine might be hard on it.<br /><br />I have never had a bed bug infestation (thank goodness!!) so can't speak to that but this cover is similar to the type you see on hotel beds everywhere these days.  For bed bug protection, if you have a box spring under your mattress, you really should encase that also.  The zipper is sturdy & has the extra protection of a Velcro closure flap so that bugs can't get in at the vulnerable end of the zipper.
11116	__label2__	4	N	Pet Products	B004S7CN42	Pet Natural’s of Vermont Daily Probiotic for Dogs, Digestive Health Supplement, 60 Bite Sized Soft Chews	Giardia in my puppy	I have two puppies with Giardia.  The vet had told me that the mother (my dog as well) most likely passed the disease down to all her puppies.  Now my puppies have stool with blood,  diareeah, and a mucus looking substance.  One of my puppies also has stomach issues.  He tends to vomit up a lot of his food depending on the day or how excited he gets.  I have purchased This product as a supplement to help my puppies with their Giardia issue as per suggestion of my vettenarian.  It seems to me that this supplement combined with the antibiotic seem to be doing the trick. My pups started to have harder and more regular stool as well as less vomiting and upset stomach.

[[VIDEOID:90ec5d5ac337c1e210d84232efc67438]] Note: The company who sells this light (Thefancy) sent me this to test, review, and demonstrate.  I hope my video review is helpful for you. (and in my humble opinion, the folks at Thefancy are very nice people.  No I don't work for them, but they're definitely someone you should buy through.)<br /><br />I use this for filming videos when I need more brilliant, white light.  I also have this out on my workbench, ready for big projects.  This would also work perfectly simply resting in the back of your car, waiting for the moment when you need a huge dose of light when changing a tire.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- Weather resistant (tough little guy)<br />- Incredibly bright.  I was stunned.<br />- Portable: Small and lightweight.<br />- Tough: There's no real "bulb" to break. It's just this little LED-looking diode.<br />- Grippy foam handle.<br />- Minimal parts to put together when it arrives (just screw the bottom on and *bam* you're good to go.<br />- Came full charged in the box.<br />- Fast charge, surprisingly long batter life (+3 hours).<br />- Rocker switch (on/off) is covered with a rubber protector, so if you have wet hands it there's less risk of water leaking into the electronics.<br /><br />Cons:<br />- My friend was rummaging around in the back cargo area in our SUB, looking for something, anything.  She finds this flood light. The front car lights up from within as she switches on the light. The dinosaur raises its head.  It turns slowly from the second car to the first car, drawn by the light.  Making a decision, it strides over to the first vehicle.<br /><br />Overall very good engineering and design.  I'm very surprised how brilliant this little brick of dynamite is. 5/5 stars.

I have a Macbook 5,1 (aluminum 2008/09) and recently my MiniDP to HDMI adapter stopped working. At first I thought it might be a Lion update that removed the functionality, but I couldn't find anything on the internet about anything similar. For the eight dollars this thing costs, I decided to see if my adapter had stopped working, and sure enough this cable fixed the problem!<br /><br />I really hope this one lasts a little longer than my previous solution...<br /><br />Note to Macbook 5,1 users: audio of MiniDP is not supported on our machine - it's a hardware thing, there are no fixes.

I put it on my nails and I didn't like it enough to bite my nails while wearing it. So, I think this is one of those things where it works well for some and not at all for others. So, I gave it a 3 star neutral rating. Maybe make it a little more potent and you'd have a winner.

The speed is impressive, no dropouts, no hangups, no glitches so far.<br /><br />Wish I could say more, but I am no techno geek, just a regular consumer who tells it as she sees it.  And this is a good card so far!<br /><br />The waterproof feature may come in handy in the future, but I do like that it is shock- and X-ray proof.<br /><br />Flawless so far, definitely recommended.

Includes Premium Applicator Pad	Good Leather Milk	I have horse saddles that always need a good rub down with leather cleaner. I also have some things around the house that could benefit from some leather conditioner. So when I was offered this Leather Care Liniment from Chamberlain's for a great deal to try and share my honest opinion about it, I ordered immediately. It arrived and I started the leather line-up. Started with the saddles, then some boots, even my leather jacket got some love. If you have leather objects that you know need some conditioning and cleaning, I recommend trying this Leather Milk from Chamberlain's.

11131	__label2__	4	N	Toys	B004KZ75JK	Ravensburger Race To The Roof - Children'S Game	Fun To Play With Children Or Grandchildren...	As a parent and now grandparent of game-lovers, I am always on the lookout for games that adults can play along with little ones.  Unlike many of games geared toward children, Ravensburger's "Race To The Roof" does not cause adults to cringe when a child presents it for playing.<br /><br />"Race To The Roof" can be played with and enjoyed by children who are younger than the suggested age range of 5 years or older.  The objects to be located are ones with which most children will be familiar; if not, the unfamiliar items provide a learning opportunity.  Counting the spaces one must move reinforces the ability to sequence numbers.  Having to move backward gives children the opportunity to "overcome" a set-back and to learn that luck sometimes plays a part in who wins and who loses.<br /><br />The quality of Ravensburger's "Race To The Roof" is a bit less than I would have expected.  Instead of a game board that is one-piece and hinged in the center, "Race To The Roof" has a two piece game-board.  Unlike older board-game playing surfaces, this item is not constructed of a very heavy cardboard. While it might be somewhat difficult for very young children to damage, determined three-year olds would have no trouble bending the pieces.  The wooden game pieces are unevenly painted; our yellow picec shows the wood-grain around its center point.  Illustrations are simplistic; this seems to be a trend with illustrations in books as well as in games.<br /><br />Ravensburger produces games that are both fun to play and provide learning opportunities for children.  I would like to see Ravensburger use better quality components so that their games last through several children and can be kept by parents to be played with future generations.

The blade cover comes off and attaches to the back end so that is handy,  Dandy little tool.

11135	__label2__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B0096Q19YU	Victor Tri-Kill Mouse Trap, 1-Pack	Easy to use, no worrying about snapped toes	The high mouse activity area in our home is the kitchen and we often place spring loaded traps on the floors along the walls and cabinets. We don't have a constant mice problem but we will get a couple each year. Usually we only know they've been around if we see droppings or if a dead one shows up in a trap. The only problem was that my husband would wake up with a dry throat, stumble into the kitchen for a drink and then get his toes snapped. I'd jolt awake to loud cursing in the middle of the night.<br /><br />But this trap eliminates that problem. It's very unobtrusive. If friends come over and see the spring loaded traps, they'd immediately know we had mice problems but with this, it's not immediately obvious what this little black box is doing on the floor of my kitchen so that's nice.<br /><br />We haven't caught any mice yet, but that may just be that there are no mice around at the moment. Will update whenever we catch one.

11138	__label2__	3	N	Automotive	B00IRBPCEI	Swiss+Tech ST53130 Polished SS 22-in-1 Pocket Multitool Kit with Wrenches, Allen Drivers, Hand Drill	Bulky Size, but Still Handy All -In -One	This tool is okay.  Just okay.  I feel comfortable with my younger son using it because there is no knife included in the tool.  But, it is very bulky and doesn't have a case or anything (which would make a bulkier tool easier to manage, I think).  I used the flathead screwdriver to help my son with a wooden frog punch out.  The screwdrivers aren't too sharp, but are of good size.  For the kid who's 8 or 9 who you just aren't quite ready to get a pocket knife for, I can imagine letting them handle this tool.  I'm going to let my 7 yo son use it.  It's going to stay in our utility drawer in the kitchen.  It's perfect for that.  I won't have to go all the way downstairs for several tools and it will be compact enough to not mind storing.  We also have an interchangeable screwdriver that we use all the time, so I'm certain this tool will be just as handy.
11139	__label2__	5	N	Office Products	B005AT2QQC	Mead 2" Zipper Binder with Handle, Includes Interior and Exterior Pockets, Red (72765)	Just plain Mead looks pretty good, even compared to Mead’s “Five Star” line	Maybe it’s just that I’ve had a lot of Mead and Mead Five Star products to review for Vine, but I’ve started ruminating on what makes the difference, quality-wise, that gets some school and office products the “Five Star” appellation and not others.  This “plain Jane” zippered binder looks to be of very similar quality to the un-killable Five Star one I have carried around for various purposes, so if there’s an “economy” angle, it’s not really that evident. And, like all zippered binders, it’s a bit pricey.<br /><br />This product’s angle is the lack of multiple specialized pockets and features that’s so common across the line.  One exterior Velcro-flapped pocket, and it’s not as big as it looks to be at first glance:  it will hold 2 pens or pencils and a few 3X5 index cards, and that’s it.  There are two nice full page sized interior pockets, though, so this will work nicely for a student with basic needs.  (Or maybe a fancy 3 ring pencil case for all the “tools”.)<br /><br />Your student may appreciate the briefcase style handle.  My kids at least are not fond of the shoulder straps on some of these all-in-ones.<br /><br />5 Star or regular, I have yet to see my kids destroy a Mead binder over the course of a year.  Tear and fray it a bit from overstuffing, yes.  But these things hold up pretty well even when they start to look like a strong gust of wind might tear them apart.  So I keep picking Mead over the no-name brands, at least where it really matters.

So, to give it a better review I gave it to my nephew who is a 12 yr boy and very mush in the target audience. He really enjoyed it.

A great help if you need to access all the boxes all the time.<br /><br />Great Plano quality too. The organizers are fine, the Only thing I may want is a stiffer more solid rack, as is , its flimsy, and the tie down used to ship them is way too tight, deforming the rack and will take some time and bending to get it back in shape.

I have been going nuts with smudging my lenses and trying to keep them clean. The cloth is fantastic because it's extra large and plush.  Usually, cleaning cloths are much smaller, making it easy to accidentally get a finger onto what I'm trying to clean fingerprints off of.  And the solution itself wipes away fast and easy, with no streaks. And the fingerprint resistant properties really seem to work; minimizing smudges and prints so I have to clean my glasses less.  I do also use it on my tablet and phone, but mostly this is being used on my eyeglasses. Very happy with it thus far. Would buy again.

Ok as sun glasses.	It is unlikely you are buying these for Fishing. If you were, these would not be a bad set of glasses for cutting glare with minimal reduction in visible light.<br /><br />For 3D however, the amount of polarization is insufficient for use with a 3D monitor or a Movie. I'm not sure who the target audience is, but these have an insane amount of &#34;cross talk&#34; as a result of not doing much to actually polarize anything.<br /><br />The glasses are well made, and reasonably stylish. Better for the $10 I spent than Drug Store sunglasses of the same price, but again that isn't what they are advertised as, and while a pipe wrench work fine for smashing walnuts, if you bought it to work on plumbing it doesn't get 5 stars if it fails to serve its primary function.

That wasn't the best plan as it turns out.  Frankly, I had the darndest time figuring out the system.  To be fair, that is nothing new for me, but I have learned to finally program my dvr for recordings.<br />So if you are like me, and you have my sympathy, then this device might be tricky to set up and operate.  However, once programmed it worked well.  I don't use it for watching the baby since mine are old enough to watch themselves.  But I did want to keep an eye on the house when not at home so it works very well thus far.  I have no reason to doubt that placing it in a child's nursery wouldn't also be helpful.

Not that this little organizer offers much extra space, but it offers enough space to alleviate the need to bring the diaper bag.  I can just throw in the wipes and diapers needed and leave the diaper bag in the car.  If you need some extra space, this is what you’re going to want.  It you want a lot of extra space, this isn’t going to do the trick.  It fits on the stroller handles easily enough, and it stays put.  For what I wanted it for, this certainly does the trick.

11157	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B00A0HT99G	Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime: The Tommy & Tuppence Mysteries	Fun But Flawed	Agatha Christie's best known detectives are Poirot and Miss Marple but far from their only ones. The 1983-84 series, Agatha Christie's Partners in Crime followed the adventures of a lesser known detective pair Tommy and Tuppence (played by James Warwick and Francesca Annis).<br /><br />Before the series began, an adaptation of the first Tommy and Tuppence novel The Secret Adversary aired as a telefilm and told of the first adventure of Tommy and Tuppence when they met after World War I in need of work and began their careers with an ad in the newspapers and found themselves involved case of international intrigue. The plot was superb with a lot of tricks and an amazing number of red herrings. The cinematography was great for the 1980s with a far better quality than the typical British TV show of the era.<br /><br />The cinematography of the main series was more typical of the era which was a definite downgrade. The series finds a married Tommy and Tuppence taking over a detective agency and assuming the pseudonym of the jailed original owner of the Agency, Mr. Blunt while Tuppence pretends to be his confidential secretary, Miss Robinson.  The stories are set in the 1920s  and the producers do a great job creating a period feel, even on a limited budget. Annis carries the show in that regard, looking very much the fashionable 1920s woman in looks as well as her general manner.<br /><br />The book upon which the series was based,  was a bit of a tongue in cheek look at popular detective fiction and that feel comes through with several tips of the cap to the great detectives while maintaining a light feel to most stories.  The pacing could be a bit slow with too much melodrama and lead to a resolution that was more than a little bit rushed.  There were some great episodes in the series, but some stinkers as well.  The best episodes in the series are arguably the last two, &#34;The Case of the Missing Lady&#34; (from a comedy standpoint) and &#34;The Cracker&#34; from adramatic standpoint with &#34;The House of Lurking Death&#34; probably the weakest.<br /><br />In the end, the series is worth watching because of the delightful performance of Annis and her chemistry with Warwick. While not a great show, like many other programs of bygone days, it will beat most of what's on television these days.

It does K-cups, one cups, or a pot, but none of them well.    Pros    1. Flexibility - you can brew coffee by all three methods.  2. Price - This is cheap for what it is. (As long as you can get it for less than 70)  3. Size - It's not too large for what it does.  4. Programmable - Unexpected bonus at this price range.    Cons    1. Horrific plastic smell and taste.  It takes forever to get rid of it.  I had to run five full pots of White Vinegar and water to get rid of it.    2. One cups are horribly messy and tons of grounds make it into your coffee.  3. K-Cups are on the slow side, but not too bad.  4. You can only put in the water you want to use at that moment.  You cannot fill the basin and brew whatever you want. If you want a k-cup, you have to measure out the water.    Overall this is an okay coffee maker.  With some improvements it could be a great coffee maker.

I gave up microwaved popcorn several years ago and have gone back to stove popped corn because it tastes so much better, plus I can control the oil, butter and salt.  After popping some corn I split it up into a bowl and a bag.  I wanted to see how it would be to sprinkle it on in a bowl, but also to be able to sprinkle it on in a bag and shake it up.  Both ways worked, but shaking it up in a bag definitely gave it a more even coverage over the popcorn.  As for the flavor I didn't love it, but I did like it and I'm actually very interested in trying the White Cheddar flavor as I think I might enjoy it a bit more.

I have a BACKUPS-XS1500 LCD uninteruptable power supply and recently needed to replace the batteries.  I didn't realize until I pulled out the APC batteries and realized there was a brand name below the white APC label that APC had slapped over the sides of the batteries, in essence putting their name on someone else's battery products.  Mine was a company named Vision.  Based on research, I discovered that APC utilizes a variety of battery manufacturers and slapped their labels on them and charges a premium.  With that being said, it is not necessary to buy an APC labeled battery for your UPS.  Find a name brand that you are comfortable with that fits the specifications of your battery.  You can, like I did, pull the label off and see who the true manufacturer is and the specifications.  In my case, I have a dual battery, meaning I have to buy two individual 12 Volt batteries and put them together into my UPS.<br /><br />So it is not necessary to pay a premium for a APC labeled battery, just go with a reasonably priced option that has a name brand and good reviews and you will be fine.

We have it temporarily on the Sleep Master Platform Metal Bed Frame until our wooden bed arrives. This is a very good combination and would be ok long term. The mattress was ready to use in 30 minutes after unpackaging even though the instructions said to allow 24 to 48 hours. It's amazing how much the mattress can be compressed for shipping. It is easy to move with a hand truck before opening the box. Just have enough space for it to expand after opening. We would have put it on the bed frame for opening but the frame didn't arrive until the next day.

11175	__label2__	2	N	Camera	B00RBG68Q6	Panasonic DMC-ZS45 LUMIX 20X Zoom Camera with Wink-Activated Selfie Feature (Black)	Very disappointing point and shoot camera.  Panasonic definitely missed the mark on this one!	I was really disappointed in the Panasonic DMC-ZS45K Lumix.  I had really high hopes for it as the functionality that is listed in the description really makes it sound like a great point and shoot camera.  I have experience with lots of different digital cameras, from the more sophisticated D-SLR cameras to the simplest disposables.  So I was really let down with this one.<br /><br />First off, for the casual user who just wants a simple point and shoot camera, I would not recommend this.  Panasonic did a horrible job of making the basic camera functions as complex as possible, requiring several steps to making adjustments that other cameras innately have available with one click or turn of a dial.  However, even if this wasn't an issue, which after a few days of use it became a little easier to remember where certain features were located, the biggest problem that I have with this camera overall is the horrible delay between pressing the shutter release button and time it takes the camera to snap the photograph.  This drove me crazy on my old freebie smart phone, so when this decently priced camera did it I was really shocked.  Basically what happens is you go to take a picture of say your children, so you line them up, tell them to smile, and push the button, you can almost count to two before the camera takes the picture.  At this point everyone has moved and the picture comes out all wrong or blurry.  It's really a shame.  I even switched the setting over to &#34;action&#34; so that it would increase the shutter speed time, and the results were exactly the same.  So if you tried to use the &#34;action&#34; mode to catch a thrilling shot at a sporting event or something, the picture would be about two seconds later than the one you tried to take!  At that timing, what's the point?<br /><br />I tried playing with the &#34;WINK&#34; setting for taking selfies, and that also needs some more engineering from Panasonic.  It works, but barely.  After setting the camera to take a picture using a &#34;wink&#34; (in the same menu as the countdown mode) you have to really be patient with it, and stand there looking like a crazy person winking slowly at your camera in an over emphasized manner in order for the camera to start a 3 second countdown to take the picture.  Even then, I could only get it to take a picture once every ten or so attempts.  Or you could just set the camera to countdown mode, press the shutter button, and the 3 second countdown happens exactly the same way.<br /><br />For more experienced photographers, Panasonic didn't help you out either.  The manual settings for adjusting aperture and shutter speed require four different steps, toggling between menu functions in order to make your adjustments.  It really shouldn't be that difficult to do these kind of changes, and really wastes a lot of good opportunities by forcing you to do them.<br /><br />There are a lot of cheaper cameras that take great pictures with so much less hassle.

11178	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00HXARJ6S	Trash Pack S6 Action Figure (12-Pack)	Trash pack series 6 are EGGcellent!	Series six rotten egg trashies are amazing!! They come hidden inside purple plastic eggs that pull apart at the side into two pieces. This series include some very fresh new and innovative designs. They pretty much all have to do with prehistoric themes. There are ancient eggs-hibits which include dino poop, boggy bonfire, and scum scorcher (also a fire character). There are scrambled animals including the very cool battered bat, puking primate, rotten tooth tiger, and soft boiled sloth to name a few. One of my favorite kinds of trashies in this series are the puke eggs. These are a clear chartreuse egg shaped outer shell with a tiny solid trashy trapped inside. These characters include a poached spider, baked bug, and waste wasp and many more. There is hard boiled trash which feature a speckled, granite like finish. There is eggs-cavated trash which look like fossilized critters stuck in a broken open rock. Some of the characters include sewer slither (a snake), soiled shrimp, oozy octopus, and runny roach. There are eggstinct trash which feature dinosaur characters. There are four limited edition trashies: slime skull, manky maggot, litter lizard, and scrambled rat. These new trash pack additions are very clever and detailed and were a serious hit with my son. Any trash pack collector will crack their shell over these!!
11179	__label2__	4	N	Pet Products	B00LE5KWS0	TEMPTATIONS TUMBLERS Treats for Cats Tasty Chicken and Turkey Flavors 2.47 Ounces (Pack of 12)	My Cats Eat Them, But Don't Care About The Balls Being For Fun...	My cat, (and the ones around the neighborhood that come around for hand outs), have always like Temptations.  This has been a favorite snack of all the cats I have had around here for just about as long as they have been making them. It's always been just a snack for them, given out as a few here and there.  And I have always liked the large variety of flavors.  Although these tumblers are made of pretty much the same ingredients as the regular Temptations, I don't like them as much, and neither I believe do the cats.  Although the idea behind these are for cats to play with their food, I don't think most get it or care, and they would just rather eat them.  Also, like a lot of other reviewers here have pointed out, these really are small balls, maybe twice the size of a BB...I don't think the cats recognize them really as balls to play with, or just don't bother too...Out of the three cats I tested them on, two ate them without playing, and one eyeballed them for a while but eventually ate them.  Perhaps finding the small balls rather unusual...    In conclusion, even if these were actually fun for your cat, I don't personally like the ball shape.  I think all three of the cats I feed prefer the Temptations in their traditional shapes that are much easier for them to chew.  The balls are made pretty small for the cats to find chewable, but its my opinion that most still don't like it...I rate these Temptations 4 stars for taste, with the one star off for the balls that I don't think are that good an idea... : )

11181	__label2__	4	N	Books	0061779741	Sacre Bleu: A Comedy d'Art	More please, Mr. Moore!	I have been a fan of Christopher Moore for quite a while now, and have read nearly all of his books - and some of them more than once. He creates wonderful characters and injects them as well as the plot and dialogue with his great sense of humour. Sacre Bleu may not have been the funniest of all of his novels to date, but it certainly still made me laugh!<br />I was hooked from the very premise - I studied art history in college, and had a lot of fun seeing cameo appearances of all of my favorite Impressionist painters (and really, a co-starring role by some of them!). It was a really fun book, with a zany plot and terrific characters. I recommend saving it for the perfect "blue" day to brighten your mood!
11182	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00IM8FXP4	Motorola MBP27T 2.4 GHz Digital Video Baby Monitor with 2.4-Inch Color LCD and Touchless Thermometer for Baby and Liquids (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Good video baby monitor except battery performance	The Motorola MBP27T is a nice video baby monitor with great features but also some limitations. It comprises of one video camera unit and one parental unit. Two different AC adapters and a rechargeable battery pack for the parental unit are provided.    The video camera unit has a decent quality comparable to VGA resolution which is more than adequate for monitoring baby activities. Don't expect sharp video like you would on your Apple or Android phones. The camera is surrounded by a ring of IR LEDs which enable night vision in a dark room. The night vision quality is serviceable. The digital pan and tilt works well but only for a few degrees in all directions. You can't pan it across the room or tilt it to the ceiling or down to the floor. Nevertheless, it is perfect for just looking around the baby's immediate surroundings. There is no zoom function and no lullaby. Lastly but not least, the camera has a microphone and a speaker to allow audio monitoring and communication.    The parental unit also has a microphone and speaker for two-way communication with the video camera unit. The audio quality is clear and works very well to pick up baby noises and to soothe a crying baby in a different room. The LCD quality is nothing to write home about. The individual pixels are quite visible and the lower quality is serviceable as a baby monitor. The parental unit has the directional buttons to pan and tilt the video camera.    One unique feature in the parent unit is the non-touch temperature sensor. You can use it to measure liquid temperature in a formula or skin temperature of the baby. I compared it with a digital thermometer on a variety of surfaces and liquids and both registered a temperature within a degree of each other (more often within 0.5 degree). It is very useful for a quick test on the temperature of a formula or that of the baby.    Now the not so good things about this baby monitor. The battery performance (in the parent unit) is outrageous. It only lastsabout 3 hours on a full charge and it takes the whole night to fully charge it. This is ridiculous in the age of mobile devices. Well, at least you can still use the parental unit while it's being charged. Also the advertised 520 ft range is outright not achievable unless you're in direct line of sight and there is no outer 2.4 GHz radio frequencies in the area. In a typical home environment with walls, furniture and a home wireless network, you're lucky if you can get a 100 ft range out of it, or maybe much less.    Another thing that I noticed is that while the video baby monitor is in operation, my home wireless network takes a hit in performance. More often than not, my WiFi transfer speed takes a dive depending where I'm at in relation to the baby monitor and the router. The wireless baby monitor operates in the 2.4 GHz radio band. There is definitely some radio interference going on. Problem is solved when I move my laptop to the 5 GHz band though.    To sum up my thoughts, the MBP27T is a decent video baby monitor with 2-way audio communication. The video quality is okay for a baby monitor (totally unlike the sharp image depicted in the Amazon product page). It has digital pan and tilt feature but no zoom. What makes this baby monitor stand out is the non-touch temperature sensor which is extremely useful for a quick check on the baby or her formula. Nevertheless, the battery performance is a letdown and may potentially limit its usefulness. Other than that, it's a decent choice.

11185	__label2__	5	N	Baby	B00A3R0EOC	Peg Perego Book Plus, Pois Black	Pois Black is hard to see in the dark - pick a brighter color.	.<br />4.5 Stars out of 5<br /><br />I am amazed at the sophistication of this stroller.  It is NOT the same animal as the under $100 varieties and in ten years it will still be a beautiful, fully loaded, functional work of art.  If your budget can absorb the sticker shock associated with this stroller, you'll be hard pressed to find something more versatile or better constructed.  I'm going to start with what I think of as the negatives aspects as there fewer of them than positives.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />*  Price - of course.<br />*  The Pois Black stroller is hard to see in the dark.  You'll trip over it at night and it makes me nervous to walk the neighborhood at dawn and dusk.<br />*  There may be too many features.  It easily becomes overwhelming to try to understand how to use them all.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />*  High quality construction with premium materials.<br />*  Extremely versatile and will continue to offer functionality and beneficial features as your baby grows.<br />*  Fairly lightweight and easy to stow into the back of the car.<br />*  You can get the baby seat from the same manufacturer and it will snap securely onto the frame.  Here's Amazon's listing:  [[ASIN:B004DIOY8Y Peg-Perego Primo Viaggio Infant Car Seat, Myrto]]<br />*  Front or rear facing functionality with a peek portal.<br />*  Plenty of onboard storage.<br />*  Water bottle holder.<br />*  Adjustable handle to easily accommodate taller as well as shorter people.<br />*  Turns on a dime - great for elevators and shopping aisles.<br />*  The rear wheels lock to help keep the stroller from creeping away from you.<br />*  Easy to clean materials.<br />*  Beautifully designed and attractive.<br /><br />There are so many other features and positive things I could say about this stroller, but I think I've gotten my point across.  I did not choose the color I received and as my only real negative, I would caution parents to select one that has bright visible colors on it.  We have tripped over this stroller in the darkness of the house (insert not-baby-friendly expletives here for stubbed toes).  I also don't feel it is visible enough for strolling the neighborhood in lower light conditions.  Add a glow-in-the-dark doo-dad here and there and you've just solved this problem.<br /><br />I have to admit that I still don't know how to quickly use every feature of this stroller.  When in doubt, I refer to the video on this page.  I've watched it at least a dozen times by now and I have it bookmarked for easy reference.<br /><br />Enjoy, and congratulations!  This Grammy is beyond delighted!
11186	__label2__	4	Y	Health & Personal Care	B007BGA1S2	Doc Ortho Ultra Soft Loose Fit Diabetic 1/4 Crew Socks: X-Large (Tan) 3 Pairs	runs small	I really like these socks especially the top which is folded over for extra comfort and strength. I appreciate the tan color because I walk around<br />the house and the whites ones show the dirt and these not so much. They are sooo soft and warm and you can't beat the price, but I think they<br />run a bit small.  I wear an 11WW womens  and they just fit so I think the sizing is misleading. My feet swell some, so at night when I take them<br />off, I see marks around the ankle where it has become tight. These are not edema socks and if my feet were more swollen than usual, I would<br />not be able to use them, but for better days, they are fine. I will probably buy more.
11187	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B0032GEHAS	Pet Buddies PB5579 FurStatic Pet Hair Broom (TPR)	Especially good for stairs and furniture.	We have a black lab that is shedding an unreasonable amount of fur this summer. We have clumps everywhere, and I have to vacuum everywhere at least once per day to make the house look inhabitable. A personality quirk of mine: I don't want to. I loathe cleaning and resent that my dog is making me do it with such frequency.<br /><br />This broom flat out works. On the floor it works great, but the three places that it really helps me out are on the stairs, in the bathroom and on our furniture. The rubber bristles collect hair very effectively.<br /><br />I hate still cleaning, but I would definitely buy this broom again. It has made an untenable situation slightly more bearable.

11193	__label2__	4	Y	Video DVD	B00D97DMBU	Scanners II: The New Order / Scanners III: The Takeover (BluRay/DVD Combo) [Blu-ray]	Telekinetic Horror Presented in Awesome Widescreen; Unfortunately, No Extras!	****No Plot Spoilers****<br /><br />  Ever since watching Brian De Palma's "Carrie" ([[ASIN:B0047E9TRA Carrie]]) and "The Fury" ([[ASIN:B000G6BLO2 The Fury]]), I've been obsessed with telekinesis.  The Scanners franchise also fulfilled my desire to watch people move objects with their thoughts.  The original "Scanners" ([[ASIN:B00005K3NY Scanners]]) was directed by David Cronenberg who became famous for his controversial science fiction horror films starring controversial actors [e.g., "The Brood" ([[ASIN:B00009PY2T The Brood]]), with brawler hunk Oliver Reed, and "Rabid" ([[ASIN:B0001XAKUQ Rabid]]) with former porn star Marilyn Chambers].  "Scanners" focuses on an emotionally disturbed, homeless scanner, Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) who meets an art gallery assistant, Kim Obrist (supermodel Jennifer O'Neill) who is also a scanner.  Together, they attempt to locate an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants the scanners to rule the world.  During their quest, they discover the dark secret concerning the origin of scanners.  Note: Scanners not only have the ability to move objects with their thoughts, but they can also read (i.e., scan) and manipulate other people's thoughts.  However, many become insane because of sensory overload.<br /><br />  Having owned "Scanners" on DVD for years, I was naturally thrilled to learn that Shout Factory had released its first two sequels as a Blu-Ray and DVD combo pack.  I saw them on VHS too many years ago in muted, full-frame formats.  Thanks to Shout Factory, each film has been presented correctly in its original theatrical aspect ratio of 1.78:1.  All colors are bright, clear and crisp and the audio is great (DTS-HD Master Audio Stereo for Blu-Ray; Dolby Digital Stereo for DVD).  Each film appears as though it has been recently released at the theatre.  There are no vertical lines or dark splotches.  I played the DVD version on my Blu-Ray player and couldn't tell a significant difference from the Blu-Ray.  The remastering for both the Blu-Ray and the DVD has been excellent.  I`ll be able to loan the DVD to my girlfriend, Tammy, who doesn't own a Blu-Ray player.  A horror buff like me, she's going to kill me with her evil thoughts when she learns I watched these films without her.<br /><br />  Both Scanners II and III were directed by Christian Duguay.  Like "Scanners," they boast gorgeous casts, contain themes of good versus evil and were filmed in and around the cold, gray environs of Montreal and Quebec, Canada.  In "Scanners II: The New Order," a veterinarian student, David Kellum (David Hewitt) is a scanner on the run who finds another scanner, Julie Vale (Deborah Raffin); together they try to destroy the corrupt Commander John Forrester (Yvan Potton) who is using scanners to kill anyone who stands in his way of becoming mayor.  Similar in plot to the original "Scanners," it has, however, some shocking twists.  Also, it has considerably more gore and violence than the original.  This one was more emotionally disturbing to me because it deals more with violence perpetrated against family members.<br /><br />  In "Scanners III: The Takeover," a Christmas tragedy causes a scanner, Alex Monet (Steve Parrish), to become a monk in Thailand.  Meanwhile, his sister, Helena (Liliana Komorowska), also a scanner, is suffering from severe migraine.  She uses her father's experimental drug and becomes insanely diabolical.  She then commandeers her father's pharmaceutical company to take over the world.  As in the previous film, there is a tremendous amount of violence and gore.  Again, there is familial violence; this time, it is even sadder when relatives attempt to kill one another.  Note: I loved the unforgettable character of Helena.  She is extremely diabolical, beautiful and sensual.  Komorowska played her perfectly.<br /><br />  There are two discs in this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  One disc contains both films on DVD and the other disc contains both films on Blu-Ray.  Unfortunately, the combo pack doesn't have any extras.  There are no subtitles, no audio commentaries, no theatrical trailers, no deleted scenes, no "making off featurettes," and, worst of all, no scene selections.  The menu gives you a choice of which Scanners movie to watch and that is all.  Unbelievable!  If not for the widescreen presentations, stereo audio and remastering, I would have thought that these two films had been released by Mill Creek, which churns out films on Blu-Ray and DVD at a high rate, regardless of quality.  Because of its blatant lack of extras, I cannot give this Scanners II and III Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack the highest rating.<br /><br />  If you are a fan of horror films, especially the ones involving telekinesis, then I recommend this Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack.  However, I wish Shout Factory had either included a digital copy or just decreased the price and given us the choice of buying the Blu-Ray or the DVD, not both.  I also wish that Shout Factory or another company would properly release "Scanner Cop" and "Scanner Cop 2: Volkin's Revenge" on Blu-Ray.  Both films star Daniel Quinn as Detective Samuel Staziak who hunts down rogue scanners.  The original "Scanners," released by MGM and out of print at the time of this review, also deserves the Blu-Ray treatment.  Many fans are hoping it will be re-released by the Criterion Collection.  My MGM release of "Scanners" only has a theatrical trailer and subtitles for extras.  A commentary from David Cronenberg would be nice.<br /><br />Joseph B. Hoyos
11194	__label2__	4	Y	Sports	B004IZ9KV8	Golf Gifts & Gallery Clubhouse Collection Electric Putting Cup	Saves time and functions well	I have a 7 year old daughter that is a competetive junior golfer.  She practices putting everyday at home and goes to the course 2x a week.  I have a large indoor putting green and just walking to the other end to gather balls is just too slow and tends to lengthen her training time.  So we decided to try this.<br /><br />PROS:<br />1.  Portable - This is very small and can be moved around as long as you have an outlet.<br />2.  Ball return - You can adjust the ball return speed.  So if you are practicing short putts adjust the speed slower so that the ball does not come back at you too fast.<br /><br />CONS:<br />1.  Moves - This does not have the weight and does not stay in place very well.  After a few putts, you will have to reposition it again since it moves.  I placed a 1 pound dumbbell on top of it so that it does not move.  It worked.<br /><br />SUMMARY:<br />Aside from having to use weights to keep it in place, it has actually been a very useful tool.  She can hit more putts during her 1 hour practice session which will help her be a better golfer.

11200	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B009JBZFVK	Onkyo A-9050 Integrated Stereo Amplifier (Black)	Great integrated amplifier, and huge value!  Get a good pair of speakers and you're 'all set'!	I sure do miss the glory days of hi-fi, when high quality stereo receivers, preamplifiers, amplifiers, and true speaker systems ruled the day!  Now everything is miniaturized and portable, with sound quality often suffering bigtime.  Sure MP3 files, iPODs, iPADs, and PC's (with their small speakers) are convenient ways to get (download) and carry music around with you, but you're missing out on palpable bass, a natural soundstage, and musical detail when you listen to most pairs of compromised headphones or PC speakers, sadly typical of most music listening done today.  Do yourselves a big favor-  if you truly love music and you wish to listen to music in all it's grandness and glory, get a good integrated amplifier (or separates- preamp and amp combo), and a great set of speakers to hook up your digital files player or PC to.  Your ears will thank you!  Contrary to belief, you really don't have to spend a fortune if you know what to look for.  Knowledge is power, and equates to savings too.  The great thing about this integrated amp is that it already has an excellent built-in Wolfson DAC, and Onkyo is a respected name in audio going back decades.  I just helped my neighbor (college student) select his very first stereo system with conventional speakers, and I suggested this integrated amp.  He also wanted a pair of good bookshelf speakers, and he ended up with JBL ES30's.  His budget was $700, which was met (including RCA to mini-plug stereo cable and a short run of thick speaker wire).  We were both floored when we listened to some of his higher-res digital files through the Onkyo and JBL's!  He said, and I quote:  &#34;I can now hear nuances i've never heard before, and I can now feel my music!  I never knew my iPOD could sound so great!&#34;  'Nuff said!

I usually don't enjoy spicy foods, but this is so delicious that I cannot resist cramming mouthfulls of tasty green stuff into my mouth. It is happiness in a jar.<br /><br />I keep jars of this around for unexpected guests and pop open a bag of tortilla chips and pour this into a bowl.

11207	__label2__	4	N	Home	B00YPVSZKC	iHomeset 12” Vintage France Paris Colorful Country Tuscan Style Wood Wall Clock	Beautiful rustic clock	This wall clock fits so well in my kitchen.  It is rustic looking and adds a neat touch to the kitchen ambiance. I have uploaded a picture with the clock hanging on the wall.  It also shows the back of the clock which shows the simplicity of the mechanics like any other wall clock.  I used a non alkaline battery since I had it on hand.  The design is not very sharp, it has like a soften look to it but it all works well together - the attached picture shows a close up of one of the edges, note that none of the pics were retouched.<br /><br />The clock I received came in very good conditions.  The 'seconds' hand is very accurate - I tested against a stop watch.  It is very light though, it only weighs 10.5 oz (without a battery).  It doesn't have a protective frame but the edge of the clock has a black sort of sealant that would keep it from chipping.  Good purchase if it fits your setting and also your budget.<br /><br />Item provided for testing purposes.
11208	__label2__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B00ARYORQC	Scotts Turf Builder Grass Seed - Centipede Grass Seed and Mulch, 5-Pound	Good Results And Easy to Use But A Bit Pricey	I used this seed to fill in areas of my lawn that had no grass because of a large tree that has now been cut down.  I followed the directions and made sure not to over-water.  The grass that is coming in looks great.  It is still too early to see how well it holds up but so far this product works very well and is easy to use.  The only downside is that it is expensive.  In the past I was able to buy a lot more seed coverage and my own mulch for less.  This package is a lot easier to use and is actually worth it for smaller areas.

It easily pops up and stays put until flattened because of the sturdy plastic rim.  The grass green color coordinates with many of my silicone kitchen accessories but there are lots of fun colors to choose from.<br /><br />The bowl is marketed for pets, but works well for human use, too, especially when space is limited, such as when travelling or in a boat or recreational vehicle.  Toddlers can play with it in the bathtub or pool.  The pleated sides and matte silicone make it easy to grip.<br /><br />The bowl holds about 12 oz. to the bottom of rim.  It weighs 58 g ( 2 oz.).  The outside diameter is 5 1/16 in. at the rim, tapering down to a 3 9/16 in. base, and the height is 2 1/8 in. The little tab adds 9/16 in. to the diameter.  When collapsed, it is 9/16 in. tall.<br /><br />Namsan provided a bowl for evaluation and review.

It takes two cubes to boil a cup of water no matter what you've read.  I have tested this on several backpacking pots, titanium/steel/aluminum, on my deck in a no wind situation and it always takes two cubes to boil a cup of water.  The time is a bit different ranging from 7 to 11 minutes based on the material and the cube (cubes weights vary a little).

She has always been into healthy foods and healthy living. Niacin has always been on the list. It's really good for circulation. Just a caution that even though some say 'flush-free', it may still cause 'flushing'. It feels like ants stinging in the areas where you need it the most. Although it can be an intense tingling, it doesn't last long. It's better if taken with food.

11215	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00IQBQN9W	Summer Infant 4-Piece Classic Bedding Set with Adjustable Crib Skirt, Medallion Taupe	both are really easy to put on	This Summer Infant crib set is different from any crib set I have owned. Instead of the usual pastel color or the new trendy colors, this is a lovely neutral taupe color. The fabric is cotton, but muslin, and so is a bit coarser than you would expect in a bedding set for an infant.<br /><br />The set includes 2 fitted sheets, a dust ruffle, and a really lovely blanket. One sheet is white, and one lightly patterned. both are really easy to put on, something I appreciate after years of struggling with crib sheets!  The dust ruffle easily adjusts to three different heights. The blanket is a nice medium weight, perfect for year round use. One side is solid, and one has an understated diamond motif. There was no shrinkage when the set was laundered.<br /><br />This set is a nice gift when you are unsure of the baby's gender or the nursery decor.

These neoprene cases are perfect for iPad mini's, with room to spare.  The bag also has room to carry their chargers and little things they want to bring along.  A stylus fits nicely in the open compartment on the front.  The inside is lined with a nice shag fleece, and the entire thing feels like a well made item.  The strap is made of the same material as a seatbelt and is soft, yet strong.  The only complaint I would have, although it's not enough to take off a star, is that for little people, the shoulder cushion isn't usable.  By the time the strap is adjusted small enough for a child, for example, the should cushion is pushed all the way to one end of the strap because the buckle will not fit through the pad.  All in all, it's minor for us in the long run, but if you are eager to use that pad, and you are small, just know that it likely won't end up at the top of the strap when it's on your shoulder.

11219	__label2__	5	Y	Luggage	B004EZG9X4	EatSmart Precision Voyager Digital Luggage Scale w/ 110 lb. Capacity & SmartGrip	Stress reliever for the flying commuter	Im on a plane every two weeks flying all over the US for work and I never leave without this in my bag. This scale is very accurate and has saved me from a lot of worry and stress when getting ready to leave for my next destination.<br /><br />Some airports in the mainland have scales off to the side for people who want to check their luggage weight before checking in but when you have two large bags and have a tight schedule, there's no time to make a pit stop there. Especially when you can see the check in lines are long and the security lines are even longer.<br /><br />I highly HIGHLY recommend this product for those who travel frequently and are heavy packers.  This has made my life so much more easier and efficient. I weigh my bags after packing and I'm ready to go.

(dont ask ;-)  This camera has lots of different settings and a good zoom with lots of modern features such as the antiblur among other things.  When I was comparing cameras, I also looked at the 2013 version of this camera the HX-30V and found them to be more or less the same, with the exception of maybe a little bit better version of zoom on the 30-V, however the 2013 version of this camera costs 70 to 100 dollars more than this one.  So if the 20 x zoom is worth the difference in price versus the 16x on this one, then go for the 30-v, but if not, then this is a good choice that takes good pictures and is reasonably priced.
11222	__label2__	3	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00CFM0P7Y	Heavy Duty 18" Brass Grill Brush - Extra Strong Solid Oak Handle - Best Value Grill Brush on Amazon - One Year Guarantee!	Not Bad, But Not Great	This is an OK grill brush.  I am using this on a Char Broil Infrared Grill with Cast Iron grates.  I cook a lot of foods with marinades and need to scrape off the burnt on crusts every time I am finished.  This brush did an OK job.  The brass bristles, which are recommended for cast iron, felt a bit too soft to scrub it well enough.  There is no scraper on this so it was more difficult for the big burnt on pieces.<br /><br />I used water and set all my burners on high for 15 minutes to get the grill to 700 degrees, but it could not get all the debris off.  This is my first time using a brush this style.  I normally use a brush with a scraper.<br /><br />I do like that the handle is long because once the water touches a hot grill, the steam is very hot.  It has a nice thick handle but did not perform like I would have liked.<br /><br />It is an OK brush.  I will go back to using my usual style brush.
11223	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B00D3KJN34	GreenWorks 24282 G-MAX 40V 150 MPH Variable Speed Cordless Blower, Battery and Charger Not Included	Enough Power For Home Owners.	Let me start my saying that my needs for a Sweeper as a traditional home owner, are simply and realistic.  This unit has just the right amount of power to blow debris, leafs and even mulch. After mowing my lawn, I take this puppy out and have no problem sweeping clippings and other debris off my driveway and various areas around my front and back yards. Wet leaves are a bit tougher and may require you getting really close with the sweeper; if the leaves are wet and stuck to the ground, then you may have to shake them off with your foot first and then sweep them with G-Max.    This tool works uses very little power from the battery, even at full blast;I have the battery powered mower which uses the same battery and even after mowing both my yards, I'm able to use the sweeper on high power without the battery dying on me.    It is light, but depending on which battery is used with it, you will feel a difference in weight, but nothing that will cause fatigue.    It has a power switch and dial. The power switch starts the sweeper and the dial controls the different speeds/power.  The main nozzle is removable and it also comes with a removable tip, which has a low and high settings, which directs the air at a different angle for a  higher/lower air flow.    Again, as a home owner, I'm pleased with my purchase. If you are looking for something basic with enough power for  house chores, then look no further, this is it. On the other hand, if you are looking for a heavy duty sweeper/blower, then go for the gas models, they have a lot of kick for heavier work loads.

I had high expectations for this battery grip. As Nixxell has been in the photography industry for years. Although I am a consummate believer in supporting your local retailer. I have found the irresistible convenience of online purchasing worth taking the risk of &#34;of hoping to get what you paid for. And actually getting it&#34;. I am also a firm believer in, &#34;you get what you pay&#34;. Simply put, you want cheap, you buy cheap, you get cheap&#34;. However this Nixxell Battery Grip which I used on my Nikon D3200. Delivered as promised. The lines of the camera body match up nicely with the top of the Battery Grip. It looks as if it came from Nikon. The weight gain with batteries installed in nominal. The rubberized contact surface for your hands allows for a sure grip on the camera body. The installation instructions were brief and left me asking more questions. Fortunately I had no issues installing it. The battery compartment door is somewhat fragile, go slow opening and shutting it. My one and only issue with this piece of equipment is. The included cable the attaches from the battery Grip to the camera body accessory connection panel. If your accustomed to shooting vertically and need the secondary shutter release button. Well you have to use the supplied cable to get that to function. Maybe the next generation Nixxell Battery Grip will find a way to accomplish this without the obtrusive cable? So did I get what I paid for? Yes ! Amazon & Nixxell have combined forces to supply the online shopper with the ease of purchasing a vast selection of products. All the while elevating &#34;Customer Support&#34; to new levels. Keep up the good work.

11229	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B00FJRS628	WD 2TB Performance Desktop  Hard Disk Drive - 7200 RPM SATA 6 Gb/s 64MB Cache 3.5 Inch, Black - WD2003FZEX	Excellent Next Generation WD Caviar Black drive	I have used WD black and RE4 (now just RE) drives for many years. I've probably used more than 100 in my desktops and light use servers and that many again in client desktops/servers. My overall experience has been excellent and this drive, so far, is no exception.<br /><br />After a week with the WD2003FZEX my first impressions are below. I'll update the review as I've lived with the drive for a while and share what I learn.<br /><br />I installed the WD2003FZEX 2TB WD Black drive into a Dell T7500 Precision Workstation. It is being used for data and is not the boot drive which is a [[ASIN:B00CKAOWB6 Seagate 600 series SSD]] that is very fast but power hungry for a SSD: good for desktops, not as much for laptops/tablets.<br /><br />I tried both the built-in SATA2 and an add-in card with SATA3. In all cases Installation was painless and uneventful. The different interfaces did not yield dramatically different results.<br /><br />To get an handle on how this drive's performance changes from the last version I ran some tests on this drive and a older [[ASIN:B004CSIFFS Caviar Black 750 GB SATA III 7200 RPM 64MB - WD7502AAEX]] for comparison.<br /><br />In running casual tests (copying large files, directories of small files, etc.) I got some general impressions of the drive:<br /><br />1) In both large files and small file copies to/from the FZEX outperforms the older AAEX but mostly shines with small file/random access. I believe the improvement for small file/random access is close to 10%. Some of this might be the dual processor and improved caching over older versions.<br /><br />2) it's more noisy than previous versions as has been noted in other reviews. It seems that is a fairly consistent pattern for rotating media drives: faster=noisier.<br /><br />3) The drive runs slightly warm - meaning comfortably warm to the touch. Good for longevity and unusual for a performance drive.<br /><br />The WD Black line of drives comes with a 5 year warranty. I have had few failues with WD drives but when they have happened I have never had a problem with warranty. This has not been so true with other manufacturers (You can read about this in my review of the [[ASIN:B00691WMJG Seagate Momentus XT 750GB Hybrid Drive]]). With a business where I run a lot of hard drives this matters. Warranty is nothing until you need it, then it's everything.<br /><br />The FZEX is a consistent step in the long evolution and ongoing improvement of the WD Black line drives. For consistent quality I have to give this drive 5 stars.<br /><br />Hope this paints a helpful picture of what the drive delivers.<br /><br />Update: Dec 27, 2013<br /><br />After living with the 2TB black drive for a while it seems more quiet than at first. This might be the drive, but I think more likely me just getting used to it. So far no issues or glitches. It is operating perfectly and still feels faster than my older WD Black line drives. I'm still quite satisfied.<br /><br />Another option from WD that is a little unusual and works in laptops and may also be good for compact desktops or all-in-one's is the [[ASIN:B00GSJ9X4Q Black2 Dual Drive 2.5&#34; 120 GB SSD + 1 TB HDD]]. This provides an OS sized 120GB SSD and 1TB HDD in one laptop sized package. This is different from hybrid drives. It uses one 2.5&#34; format package to implement the popular desktop combo of a SSD for the OS and a conventional drive for bulk data. It's on the expensive side but is a good solution for a combination of speed and bulk data. I installed this for a client who does video editing on a laptop.

11232	__label2__	4	Y	Electronics	B00823170Y	Sewell Direct Universal Soundbar Bracket	Decent and effective brackets for sound bar	Bought these to mount a Vizio speaker under a 39 Inch Samsng flat screen.  Mounting worked well, but these brackets have a fair amount of flexibility which makes them &#34;feel like the speaker isn't secure.  It is.  The TV I mounted it to is on a swivel wall mount, and whenever the TV is adjusted the speaker sways back and forth a bit as the metal flexes.  This is made from a fairly thin grade of metal, so it is certainly not rigid.  In our setup, mounted to the TV with the wall mount at the same time, the brackets allow the sound bar to move L-R as well, which means it gets knocked off of &#34;level&#34; fairly easy.<br /><br />All that being said, I like the brackets, but not enough for five stars.  It is adequate for what we need, but it does not exceed expectations.
11233	__label2__	5	Y	Office Products	B003CTI9FY	VTech DS6151 2-Line Expandable Cordless Phone with Digital Answering System and Caller ID with 4 Extra DS6101 Handsets	This Product is GREAT!	I'm an old retired telephone man (AT&T, SBC, SW Bell). I had a 12 year old 2-line VTech system that had served us well but one hand set was hard for me to hear on and the battery's wouldn't hold like they did when new. I never really liked cordless phones because they were always causing trouble (noisy, buzzing in the back ground) and us repair tech's would have to tell the customer that their high $$ phone was causing their problem. I thought the old VTech phones we had were good but not as good as a hard wired phone. These new VTech 2-line phones with the DECT 6.0 Digital technology are AMAZING. Their quality is better than my AT&T 2-line hard wired phones. VTech phones are the best I have ever used and these new ones are the best of the best! I had bought a VTech single line phone about two years ago when I moved one of my phone lines to VOIP and that phone has the DECT 6.0 Digital technology and the quality on it has been superb. GREAT Amazon shopping experience. This seller was prompt in shipping the item to me and it was a great product with a great price. THANKS

11235	__label2__	5	N	Camera	B0000A5A9U	Gitzo G1077M Magnesium 0 Series Ball Head	Great Head for Table Top Tripods & Small Cameras	The G1077M is part of the Gitzo Classic Center Ball Head series, marketed as a petite head for travelers and matched to their carbon fiber Mountaineer tripods. I bought it in 2004 to use on a Gitzo G1028 Mountaineer. My gripped EOS 10D and 17-40 4L USM zoom were too close to the 4.4 LB load limit and I was fighting drifting in portrait orientation. So rather than struggle with every angle, I bought the next size up, the Gitzo G1177M, rated to 8.8 LB. All it needed was a modest amount of torque and the angle was locked. The G1177M became my favorite head and traveled with me for a decade.<br /><br />The wee G1077M languished for years in a desk drawer, unused and forgotten. I started shooting with an Olympus E-P3 micro 4/3 system and needed a small tripod to complement it. So I installed the G1077M on my Manfrotto 209B table top tripod and the combo was magic: balanced, light and smooth as silk. And no drift whatsoever. The E-P3 felt like it belonged on that head. Although the E-P3 is metal and armed with an EVF and fast prime, it's still a lightweight compared to even a petite DSLR.<br /><br />So while the G1077M is not well suited for heavy DSLRs, it is ideal for compact cameras like M4/3 or point 'n shoot, and at its best mounted on a table top tripod like a Manfrotto 209B or Giottos QU500. In a pinch, a DSLR works fine on the G1077M as long as you stick to horizontal orientation.<br /><br />CONSTRUCTION: Most metal parts are magnesium for strength and minimal weight. The ball housing sports an attractive sliver and black speckle enamel and, after years of use, has proved to be surprisingly chip and scratch resistant. The bottom is tapped for a standard 3/8 inch tripod mount thread. The top platform has a 1/4 inch bolt for mounting a camera.<br /><br />A single large knob is used for locking the ball. There is no separate tension knob. To mount a camera you loosen it and turn the top platform until the screw is snug. The platform is large and knurled for a sure grip even in wet weather.<br /><br />One odd thing I noticed while everything was apart was the ball is hollow and I could look down the stem and see out the bottom. Probably the hollow ball is a weight saving measure.<br /><br />KIRK QR Clamp Install: I have Arca-Swiss quick release plates on all my cameras so I decided to add a small Kirk QR clamp to the G1077M [[ASIN:B006U43AMA Kirk Enterprises 1'' Quick Release Clamp]]. First I screwed it into the 1/4 bolt on top of the disk. I soon realized the disk was redundant and removed it, mounting the Kirk clamp directly on the ball stem. The appearance is OEM and the operation is smooth, fast and natural. The installation of the Kirk clamp on the stem was harder than expected due to Locktite on the threads. I had to hold the stem still with a small pliers (with cloth to keep from scratching it) and unscrew the disk with rubber gloves for extra grip. The 1/4 inch stud had Locktite too and I had to use the pliers to remove it too. I cleaned off the Locktite and repositioned the stud so the top was flush with the top of the Kirk clamp (& deeper in the stem). And, yes, I applied a wee bit of Locktite 242 to keep the rig from turning under load. So 30 minutes of toil but what a great lightweight combo!<br /><br />LOAD CAPACITY: This is only a 120 g head and rated for light duty loads of 4.4 pounds, albeit the true capacity is much lower. I've owned heads from Manfrotto, Gitzo, Sunwayfoto and Really Right Stuff and they all greatly exaggerate load capacity. The Manfrotto and Gitzo heads tend to lock securely at about 50% of their rated load capacity. Indeed, I found about 2 LBs to be the true capacity while using the drop slot or at a steep angle. I recently tested a [[ASIN:B00AMNWXDW SUNWAYFOTO FB-28 Mini Tripod Ball Head Arca Compatible 7 oz Sunway FB28]], rated at 26 LB, and found the true capacity to be about 2 LB as well.<br /><br />LAST BLURB: The weight and space conscious traveler desiring a high quality head for point'n shoot and M4/3 cameras can't go wrong with the G1077M. And it is even better with the Kirk QRC-1 mounted topside, making for fast and secure connections. The Gitzo-Kirk pairing appears OEM and the combined operation is smooth, fast and natural.<br /><br />Finally, many will question why would anybody in their right mind spend upwards of $160 for a table top tripod. I certainly wouldn't if I didn't already own a G1077M. Nevertheless, this rig is light, fits in my jean pocket and provides amazingly solid support for my Olympus E-P3 camera.

11238	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00IVDVX86	Fisher-Price Power Wheels Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler	Probably the Best Thing Ever For Young Boys	I can't think of anything more fun as a young boy than driving around in a Jeep of my own and if my nephews' reaction to the Fisher-Price Hot Wheels Jeep Wrangler is any indication, they agree. They LOVE (and I mean absolutely without a doubt love) this Jeep more than anything else they have ever played with!<br /><br />The 6-year-old actually helped put it together (the directions were very easy to follow!) though I suggest using a power screw driver. That would have made the assembly much quicker- there are tons of screws used to put it together! It's helpful to have two people to put it together but not absolutely necessary. This is something to consider if you're planning on assembling this Christmas Eve.<br /><br />The 6-year-old is a tall 49&#34; but has no problem fitting in the jeep and he learned very quickly how to switch gears between fast, slow and reverse. His brothers (4 and 2) take turns riding as passengers. The middle one can drive it but he's not as confident and savvy as his older brother so he hasn't done much driving yet- he's content to just ride.<br /><br />The charging process isn't bad at all. You leave the battery in the jeep and unplug the Jeep's power plug and then attach the wall charger plug with the battery still in the jeep. Makes it very easy. We just leave it in the garage and plug it in after every use like they suggest. It runs out of juice after about 1 1/2 -2 hours of constant high-speed driving. I'm actually happy that it requires charging time though or the boys would never want to do anything else.<br /><br />There's a little battery powered radio that plays music with real buttons to push. My little boys love that feature, especially as passengers. It requires AA batteries that aren't included.<br /><br />The Jeep maneuvers very well on the sidewalks and on concrete. It has to work a little harder going through grass but still works okay going up small hills around our neighborhood. One drawback is that it is pretty loud andas the boys want to get out and play as soon as they wake up in the morning I worry that they're waking my neighbors up. No complaints yet though!<br /><br />After about 3 weeks of daily riding it is still in great shape! With 3 boys that is a huge positive in my book and kind of surprising. It's very sturdy and well made.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this Jeep to anyone with kids. They will love it!

11243	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B00NC9TT8A	Into the Woods: Stephen Sondheim	(DVD REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars.  Strong performances, great music	In anticipation of the new film version of "Into the Woods" I decided to take a look at this Tony winning stage production which used the original cast.  It was actually filmed for a television episode of American Playhouse that aired on March 15, 1991.  It is available on DVD and Blu ray.<br /><br />The story by James Lapine, who also directs, blends together various fairy tale characters (Cinderella, Little Red Riding Hood, Rapunzel, Jack and others) into one story.  The nexus is the Baker (Chip Zien) and his Wife (Joanna Gleason) and their inability to conceive a child.  The local Witch (Bernadette Peters) agrees to reverse the Wife's "condition" but the couple must bring her 4 items.  A red Cloak, a gold shoe, a white cow and "yellow as corn" hair are her demands.  Somehow these items together would release the curse of the Witch's grotesque features.<br /><br />Working with one basic stage, the production is pretty rudimentary but is buoyed by the music of the great Stephen Sondheim.  Peters is of course a terrific singer and gets many of the big number including the tearful "Children Will Listen."  I was also taken with Ms. Gleason's humorous take the Baker's wife.  She also has a fine singing voice.  I'm most familiar with her as a supporting actor in numerous films.<br /><br />The rest of the actors are very good and have seasoned singing voices.  The costumes were pretty original.  I was a bit surprised to see the Wolf's (Robert Westenberg) costume to be anatomically correct below the belt.  This must be a little concerning for some, especially in the first scene where he confronts Little Red Riding Hood (Danielle Ferland).<br /><br />The DVD is problematic.  The video is washed out and not very pretty to look at.  The editing and direction are pretty good however.  Audio is only available in stereo but it is fine.  The music is great, the story is interesting and the acting is top notch.  I highly recommend going for the Blu ray.
11244	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B00DL48BM6	The Monuments Men	THE IMPORTANCE OF HISTORY	We live in a throw away society, a world where everything is expendable and ready to be tossed aside once we've finished with it. Kids today seem only interested in themselves and what's going on in the present, never caring what happened before they were born. The saddest part of this is the fact that in being this way they never expose themselves to some of the greatest things in the world, everything from classic novels to pieces of art that have survived centuries. With any luck a few of them will watch THE MONUMENTS MEN and consider doing so.<br /><br />George Clooney stars as Frank Stokes, a military officer in World War II who presents a case to President Roosevelt about the famous works found in museums in Europe. In this presentation he shows Roosevelt famous pieces of art that have gone missing, supposedly taken by Hitler to be put on display when he wins the war in a specially built structure. That is if he doesn't damage them first or if the allies don't damage them while fighting battles from one town to the next. Stokes request is that a special select group of men work to save these pieces of art before they are all destroyed. Given the go ahead, he assembles his team.<br /><br />The team is small. There aren't that many people qualified or willing to be a part. Each has their own role to play in helping with this seemingly impossible task. Included in the group are James Granger (Matt Damon), Richard Campbell (Bill Murray), Walter Garfield (John Goodman), Jean Claude Clermont (Jean Dujardin), Preston Savitz (Bob Balaban) and Donald Jeffries (Hugh Bonneville). These are the Monuments men, the elite group that sets out to fulfill the task Stokes has set forth. Granger is sent undercover to find out as much information as he can concerning the whereabouts of artwork stolen in France. The rest are split into teams and sent searching for other various artifacts.<br /><br />Using various methods they accumulate enough knowledge that they discover a patternused in the transport of these works of art. It appears that each location on the map they point out with the clues presented there are underground mines where the art has been stored, at least in part. As the troops move forward, the team accompanies them in an attempt to fulfill their mission. Placing their lives in danger, not all will come home, but each will play his part in this truly historic mission.<br /><br />This gives you the basic idea of what the movie is about. What it doesn't do is show the admiration these men had for not just the task at hand but the items they were sent to save. While some might find a Rembrandt of a museum quality piece of artwork in a foreign church boring, these men look upon each with reverence and respect. The military might see their job as unworthy of their efforts but a twist results in them finding more than they bargained for.<br /><br />Based on the true story of this team the movie offers it all. There is plenty of camaraderie among the team, an affection that develops between them as they move forward. There is the awe that each one inspires with the items they find. There is humor in various moments where things can be light hearted. And there is tragedy as some fall to the enemy.<br /><br />What makes this movie important though is to consider what it was they actually accomplished. To think that some of these pieces might have disappeared (which some actually did) makes their story one of success where few thought it could happen. That they were able to rescue as much as they did is an amazing feat and one that should be lauded. I found it amazing that it took this long for their story to be told.<br /><br />The movie offers not just great entertainment but a piece of history that all should be made aware of. It's a film that young people should see to realize that there was a world out there before they were born and that many things they take for granted could simply have not been there if not for the efforts ofpeople like this. Ipads, Ipods and Facebook are all great things but not near as great as what these people saved. It would be nice to know that at least a few people in the world appreciate the work that they did. Hopefully young people will find enough interest to watch this movie and feel a bit of that.

This comes with a station and sixteen refills, and it is easy to use and refill.<br /><br />I want to note that while it says it is tamper-resistant, I would NOT use it where children are just to be safe, and I could not see using this thing indoors. Personally, I  do not want to be playing &#34;where's the stink coming from?&#34; and do not know many people who do. As with any poison, I also would not use it anywhere that a pet could come in contact with it. These things do not harm the overall product, in fact I think they speak of its effectiveness.<br /><br />It works really well.

This is a beautifully organized, clearly written cookbook for just about every kind of marinade you could want, and it also provides you with the framework for making your own marinades, should you wish to do so.  Some of the ingredients, while just a bit out of the ordinary, are not impossible to get and certainly aren't cost-prohibitive.  Of course, not all marinades work equally well with meat/fish/poultry, so Lucy Vaserfirer has made things all that much easier for us by recommending which critters (and which cuts) work best with each particular marinade.  She also has marinades which work well for vegetables.<br /><br />Calling this a 400-recipe cookbook is a bit silly.  There are 200 marinade recipes and regular recipes which seem also tacked on as an afterthought.  But who cares?  200 different marinades is more than sufficient to make this cookbook a must-have for your kitchen library.

11252	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B002XDR5OG	Kisses for My President	"Man needs an office, especially if he has nothing to do."	1964's KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, once a political fable, seems less so today. It's still very much a mild-mannered battle of the sexes, a vehicle that Tracy and Hepburn would've had a field day with. Leslie Harrison McCloud (Polly Bergen) - ex-judge, ambassador's daughter, senator's niece - has all the tools in the shed to carve a bright future in Washington, D.C. When a successful campaign has her elected as the U.S. President, her affable husband, Thaddeus (Fred MacMurray), sells his business so he could better serve as the White House's First Gentleman.<br /><br />Polly Bergen is very good and believable as our Commander-in-Chief. She demonstrates firm command in scenes when she's fulfilling her presidential obligations, but then loosens up in those private moments with her husband. Unfortunately, those private moments come few and far between and don't ever last very long. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT, for the most part, concerns Thad McCloud's harsh acclimation to his new role. It's a comic study on the trivialization of a man.<br /><br />Did you know that Fawcett Comics' Captain Marvel was modeled after Fred MacMurray? His face, anyway. In this movie, MacMurray starts out less the superhero, more the milquetoast. How out of sorts must he have been, relegated as the man behind the woman, hamstrung from voicing his political opinions? As the First Gentleman, he merits an office (dainty), two secretaries (old), and certain tasks (emasculating) expected of his post. One of these tasks becomes a send-up of Jacqueline Kennedy's famous televised White House tour.<br /><br />Another is fairly crucial to the plot. When odious dictator of a third world country, President Raphael Valdez (a cartoonish Eli Wallach), calls on the White House to demand a fiscal loan, the U.S. President's delaying tactic has her assigning her husband to escort him around D.C. I'm not saying that this is an awful idea...<br /><br />Thad is accused by an adversarial senator of incompetence, of sabotaging foreign relations, of sullying the presidential office. Good for Thad, he gets a shot at redemption at the senate hearing. But there's also tension from the matrimonial front. His wife being so preoccupied all the time, Thad has taken to spending (platonic) time with an old flame (Arlene Dahl). She's been cozying up to him, she who runs an empire of man's cologne. She extends him a business proposition that he mulls over, and you The viewer are left talking to the screen. "You silly dupe!" I heard you say.<br /><br />One more sub-plot, and it's an interesting one. It's to do with the McCloud children and how they start to act up. The elementary-grade son (Ronnie Dapo) starts bullying his classmates and even his teacher because he thinks his Secret Service bodyguards will back him up. The teenaged daughter (Anna Capri) and her boyfriend are all the time getting pulled over for speeding and she's been pulling the "My mom's the President" card to get out of tickets. The resolution is pretty mundane. That these kids act up the way they do makes for a fairly fascinating exercise in psychology. It certainly lends depth and dramatic content to the narrative.<br /><br />The timing of the theatrical premiere sucked so bad. KISSES FOR MY PRESIDENT bombed, and maybe it shouldn't have had. It certainly presents a plentitude of amusing moments and the two leads work well in concert. But the subject matter was a touchy thing in 1964, what with Kennedy's assassination having taken place only less than a year before. An American nation, perturbed and knackered still, probably didn't have it in it to chuckle along. It's almost as bad form as that old joke: "So how'd you like the play, Mrs. Lincoln?" 3.5 out of 5 stars. I took half a star off because of the very disappointing sell-out ending.

The instructions say to apply it 3 times each day for 4 to 6 weeks.  I have to give this product a review before then, so all I can say is that it smells like turpentine.  My husband waved the open bottle under my nose and asked me what I thought it smelled like and it definitely smelled like turpentine.  The active ingredient listed is: Thuja occidentalis.  According to Wikipedia it is this:<br /><br />  Thuja occidentalis is an evergreen coniferous tree, in the cypress family Cupressaceae, which is native to the northeast of the United States and the southeast of Canada, but widely cultivated as an ornamental plant.<br /><br />There's a lot more said about it, but it's a tree.

Otherwise it's not strong enough.<br />*Accessibility of inputs/outputs and buttons is as good as it probably gets while also having an unobtrusive scheme for securing iPad.<br />*The iPad is very secure in this case, another necessity.<br />*Outside leather material feels good and appears to be well-stitched.  Inside material is thin and lightweight while not being so nice.<br /><br />This is a good case overall.  The best thing about it is the good feel of it and the fact it secures the iPad while being small and lightweight.

Also, it comes very well packaged both by the manufacturer and then Amazon makes sure it is even safer.

While that rarely seems to work when a company tries to do the same with a movie, TellTale has expanded on what they did perfectly with The Walking Dead and given gamers and comic book fans alike another fantastic release with The Wolf Among Us.<br /><br />The Wolf Among Us is based on Bill Willingham's Fables comic book series. And unlike The Walking Dead where the characters were mostly different but lived in a parallel time period as the characters in the source material, the characters in The Wolf Among Us are straight out of the source material. I was a huge fan of The Walking Dead comic before I played the TellTale game, but I have not read the Fables comics, so I cannot confirm whether or not the game follows the comic book storyline. My understanding is that it does not, but I'll come back and clarify that once I do indeed confirm.<br /><br />But like The Walking Dead Game, you certainly don't have to have read the comics to enjoy this game; just be sure that you are planning to get into and be part of a story-rich experience. And here's the gist: Turns out that fairy tale creatures created in writing (or film) actually `come to life', and many of them have taken residence in an area of New York City called...you guessed it... Fabletown. The sheriff, Bigby Wolf, that's right..."Big Bad Wolf," is protector of all the Fabletown characters, and when one of them is murdered, you take on the role of Sheriff Bigby and try to figure out whodunit.<br /><br />Along the way in just the first episode you'll meet characters from stories such as Little Red Riding Hood, the Three Little Pigs, Snow White, The Wind in the Willows, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow, Beauty and the Beast, Beowulf, The Wizard of Oz and a couple of other popular (and not so popular) fairy tales. But these characters are a bit...shall we say...out of character as they curse, party hearty and behave quite differently from that in which the stories that created them. The game earns its M rating.<br /><br />There are plenty of action sequences, but your time in this game is mostly spent literally being a part of the story making some tough (and some not so tough) decisions. It's the tough decisions that will affect how the rest of the game unfolds for you, and you'll have to live with the consequences of every option you choose.<br /><br />TellTale has done it again: The Wolf Among Us is excellent...especially for just a point and click. It's a gritty and graphic interactive comic book, and it's very story-rich. The graphics are appropriately very comic-bookesque. And as far as gameplay, I really do feel like I'm a character in a comic book! You might not like this game if shooters or action games are your thing. You will love this game if you read comics and graphic novels as I do. Check this game out, or I'll huff and I'll puff and....

The buttons are very stiff and sometimes take a few presses to work. Plus I wanted a scale - not an eating program. This is the first kitchen scale I have seen with an 11 lb capacity that does not display lbs/oz. For example, I want to see 5 lbs 8 oz. Not 5.5 lbs. I should not have to convert fractions to ounces every time. The only other option is all ounces, but then I have to calculate 16 oz per pound. Yea, it's simple - but it's a pain.  I actually expected this scale to real lbs/oz. If I could I would return it, but Amazon hits for restocking and shipping. Not worth the loss. So much for the product's satisfaction guarantee.

ALL of these seeds were sown in a plant house environment. The only seed that sprouted was a single watermelon plant. Not a single blueberry, blackberry or strawberry plant sprouted from the seeds purchased from ROBsRAREandGIANTseeds.<br /><br />At the same time as planting the seeds listed above, I also planted several tomato, cucumber & pepper plants seeds that were purchased from another supplier.

My son is about the average weight and height of a newborn, 7 lbs 14 oz, 21 inches.<br />I used it with his arms sticking out for about two weeks, then we moved on to fleece sleeping sacks with sleeves.<br />Not a very good purchase.

11273	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B005FUTBZA	The Conversation [Blu-ray]	A PARANOID CLASSIC	In 1972 director Francis Ford Coppola made one of the greatest movies ever done THE GODFATHER. Using the clout he developed from that film he made another classic that didn't get near the intention. That movie has just arrived in blu-ray format. Its name is THE CONVERSATION.<br /><br />Gene Hackman stars as Harry Caul, a surveillance expert with a reputation for being able to record anyone, anywhere. The film opens with Harry and his crew recording a conversation between a young couple in an open air park. Using various pieces of equipment from parabolic microphones to microphones hidden in bags they put together each to come up with a conclusive piece of work.<br /><br />But the movie isn't all about this conversation. It's more about Harry himself. As portrayed by Hackman, Harry Caul is a loner, a man without much in his life with the exception of his work. He does have a girlfriend (Teri Garr) that he provides for and sees on occasion. But there is this underlying nagging fear we witness in Caul that has him keeping people at arms length including the people who work for him. Harry Caul is a classic paranoid individual but one who knows how easy it is to gain access to the details in a person's private life. Knowing this means Harry realizes how vulnerable we all truly are and how susceptible each person is to being watched.<br /><br />As the pieces come together on the project Harry is working on he begins to wonder about what he's recording. Filters are used to fine tune each piece, to bring together a comprehensive conversation where no words are distorted or left out. In the past Harry has made a practice of not becoming involved, in not listening to the things he was recording. But as he puts this one together, he begins to worry that perhaps this couple is about to be killed by his employer.<br /><br />When he goes to give the tape to his employer he is first pushed aside by his aide played by a young Harrison Ford. Eventually he meets with the man portrayed by Robert Duval. Paid for his services Harry leaves but still feels concern about what will happen.<br /><br />Going to a trade show of security and surveillance experts, one of Harry's employees is there working on the side with another expert. Bernie Moran (Allan Garfield) is perhaps second only to Caul. But rather than downplay his expertise, he's capitalized on it becoming a major player and manufacturer of electronic surveillance equipment.<br /><br />Eventually Harry is talked into allowing Moran and friends up to the loft he uses where they work. Moran continues to push Harry trying to find out how he did a particular job back east that resulted in the deaths of several people. But the reclusive Harry holds back, acting rather shy with the group. When it's revealed that Moran placed a microphone on Harry in an ink pen, Harry explodes and orders everyone out.<br /><br />Still concerned with the conversation he recorded Harry checks into the hotel where the couple said they would meet. Taking the room next door, he overhears an argument and then witnesses through a frosted pane of glass someone being murdered. Plagued with these images it tears at him.<br /><br />When he tries to confront the man who hired him, Harry is turned away. To give away what happens during the final portion of the film would be akin to telling you who the mother was in PSYCHO.<br /><br />The film is a dive into the mind of a man who peers into the private lives of other and who attempts to not have a private life of his own for fear someone will do the same to him. This lone individual with a conscious is doing unconscionable things, but continues to do so to make a living. It is brilliantly made and perhaps one of Coppola's best films but overlooked by many.<br /><br />Hackman gives an outstanding performance. His role could have been played over the top with rages and flamboyance but instead Harry Caul has more depth in the slow moving actions and scenes that have him doing nothingmore than listening than many actors offer when chewing scenery all around them. His role here should have landed him an Oscar.<br /><br />While the movie was overlooked in many ways for years fans have had the chance to find it as it has been released in formats from VHS to DVD. Now that it's available on blu-ray it is one that should be added to the collection of any die hard movie fan. And if you're a fan of Coppola or Hackman you should be out there picking up a copy as soon as you finish reading this piece.

11275	__label2__	5	N	Furniture	B002VA32F2	Cozy Sack 2-Feet Kids Foam Bean Bag Chair, Small, Navy	Worth the extra money	I was looking at bean bags and almost bought a cheaper one but I am glad I spent a little more time looking at the less positive reviews on the bag I almost bought. They complained of cheapness and odor (like chemical odors). I certainly didn't want something from China off-gassing in my house. Once of the reviews recommended a Cozy Sack instead, so I looked those up and found this item.<br /><br />I ordered a 4' navy bag and it arrived today. I thought the packaging was a bit small and that it might not be big enough, but after taking it out and letting the foam absorb some air, it might even be too big for my originally desired use. It was a bit of a struggle to get it out of the tight packaging without using a knife or blade, but I managed.<br /><br />And fortunately it doesn't stink of chemicals (unless you put your nose right up to it and take a big whiff)! If it did my wife would have had me remove it right away (she is very sensitive to that).<br /><br />My 6 year old son immediately started jumping on it from a couch and had a blast. He then settled down on it and played some games on an iPad, so there's no doubt he likes it.<br /><br />I'm happy I spent a little more for what is most likely a significantly better quality bag that has a removable & washable cover. I'm also happy that I am supporting jobs in the USA, which I don't mind at all doing when they offer a higher quality product that is worth the additional cost over cheaper & lower quality Chinese made products.<br /><br />Unfortunately the 4' was too big for us but the customer service was excellent and helped us convert it into 2x 2' bag chairs by exchanging the cover & bags. I transferred the foam 'stuffing' from the 4' to the 2x 2' bags.<br /><br />By the way, currently the photo for the 2' navy bag with the child sitting on it shows a lighter blue color. The actual color is a darker navy blue as you might expect.<br /><br />Here's some size info:<br /><br />The 2' size has a diameter of 34&#34; and is 20&#34; high<br />The 3' size has a diameter of 44&#34; and is 24&#34; high.<br />The 4' size has a diameter of 48&#34; and is 27&#34; high.<br />The 5' size has a diameter of 48&#34; and is 40&#34; high.<br /><br />So 5 stars from me... should anything change then I'll definitely update this review.

I take it for walks with the dog so I don't have to pick up dog poo through a plastic bag.  Not a fan of touching it, even if there's a bag between me and the poop.  That said, my wife does not love it.  She thinks it is too big/long to carry around.  The smaller size one is probably good enough, but this is good if you have a lab or large dog.  We have a lab and if she goes #2 multiple times on a walk, I'm glad I have this one and not a smaller one.<br /><br />Very well built, have owned for a few years now and is is showing no signs of wear.  I also use this to pick up our yard.  I like it a lot and would recommend.

11278	__label2__	5	Y	Electronics	B00006ICIW	RCA RCU403 3-Device Universal Remote (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	You be da boss.	Great little remote for basic functions (though what I received is quite different from the picture, at least cosmetically). The Sony TV and Time-Warner cable box codes were accepted on first try.  Then it was time to add the Sony DVD player, and the instruction sheet offered 8 codes. I went through the first seven with exponentially diminishing hopes--until I was down to a barely flickering futile flame.  Wouldn't you know--#8 was the right code!  Proof there's a god after all!  (All the same, if none of the numbers works, there's another form of entry to try called "Code Search.")<br /><br />Lesson learned. Never give up--never.  But if you're struggling with this inexpensive gadget for more than 20 minutes, don't hesitate to toss it.  Life is too short--and the distance between me and my TV isn't really that long.  Moreover, there's no way to store favorite channels--even a mere several. That wouldn't be a problem were it not for Time-Warner's 2000-channel line-up (and of course the HD channels are all up in the 4-digit zone).<br /><br />Anyway, this $5 toy is a potentially useful "spare."  (Don't lose the instruction sheet!)<br /><br />[The price has gone down even more!  For Pete's sake (and anyone else in the family), pick up several of these as stocking stuffers.  Every American deserves their own remote (for example, to turn on, or off, Chumley) . And teachers, take notice.  When doing a frame-by-frame, close analysis of "Citizen Kane" (Charlie's attempt to push away Mr. Thatcher with his sled), or "On the Waterfront" (Brando's "could've been a contender" speech"), or "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari" (the prototype for Scorcese's "Shutter Island"), let the students do the work (they learn more that way).]

We tired of this game after about a half hour of play.  Not rewarding at all.  This is not much different from the days of bad movie titles on the original NES which seemed to be all based on the running/jumping/collecting variety.  Rent this or get it dirt cheap.

11281	__label2__	2	Y	Lawn and Garden	B000SDKGC6	Wire Tek 1001 EasySet Mole Eliminator Trap	No Luck In Georgia	Maybe because the clay soil is like a rock or maybe because my moles have become highly educated but I've not snagged one mole in three weeks. I have tunnels everywhere and holes all over my yard but no dead moles. The trap seems like a good idea and it's well constructed but I don't think it's made for my area of the country. It's difficult as crud to set with the hard soil but once set it has never tripped. I've moved it to different locations but still no luck. The design seems like a good idea so maybe it'll work in your area. I'm going to keep trying and if I get positive results I will correct this review. Not recommended for clay soils.

This protector easily fit the bill. I looked at several squid-style protectors, but they usually didn't have enough outlets. Not only does this have eight rotating outlets, it has four more stationary outlets in the center for an incredible twelve outlets.<br /><br />The unit was also simple to mount to the wall. I just used a few screws that I had sitting around and some drywall anchors and had the plug mounted on the wall in minutes. I am not any sort of do-it-yourself expert.<br /><br />Finally, one of the really great—but perhaps less-noticed—features of this strip is its cord organizer. The clip on the bottom is an easy way to tuck away all of your cords and send them off in the same direction. Not only does that make it easier to, for example, use some other cord system on the bundle of plugs (like a tube or zip ties), it helps keep the cords neat even if you don't use any other cord-management tools.<br /><br />This is particularly useful if, for example, you're using this strip for an aquarium or other water-related project, because the clip helps you make a drip loop without having to add more holes to the wall, etc.<br /><br />In sum, this is a great power strip. I strongly recommend it to others.

I have just started using this powder by making it in my own capsule form. I use size &#34;00&#34;. It's a little early to comment on the actual benefits as I am early in the regiment. The batch I received was light in color and most definitely bitter. I have used some 200:1 powder from a different supplier but, have noticed no significant difference between the two, other than color, the 200:1 was darker. I am impressed by the careful and professional packaging by Hard Rhino. While this may seem insignificant, usually those who take pride in their product also take pride in their packaging. I would and have bought other powders from Hard Rhino. I do however have one suggestion and that would be to clearly indicate the Country of Origin from where the powders come from. This is as much a part of the evaluation process as the effectiveness of the product itself.

This usually works, but every so often, the cats, of different ages go on strike (As in: where should I pee today? Is next to the box as good as in the box?

11291	__label2__	5	N	Baby	B00PX8PIC4	Graco Comfy Cruiser Click Connect Travel System, Stratus	Good and priced well	Buying a travel system can be confusing. I went to Graco's website and still had a hard time telling why some cost more than others and I always find that it's something silly like adjustable height for the handle or something.  I have this system [[ASIN:B00ASI748K Graco FastAction Fold Click Connect Travel System/Click Connect 30, Finley]] to compare to.    So what do you get?  A car seat.  A base for the car seat.  A stroller.    The stroller is going to have the most feature difference between all the travel systems.  This stroller has one hand closing system. There is a button in the middle of the handlebar of the stroller that you push. Turn the the handle (where the button is attached) and then let go. Then you can use the same hand to pull the tray towards you and it closes. And it stays upright.    I can't open it one-handed though.    The other Graco system I mentioned above had the handle in the base of the stroller that you pull and and it folds (almost lifting it). I like this one better.    This system has locks for the front wheels if you don't want them to swivel (manual mentions grass).    The storage area is bigger on this system.    The base is different also. The old base I have has a bubble-level to get the seat in the car at the right angle. The problem with that is that there is so much leeway that it was useless.    This system does away with the bubble and has a red line on the base that must be level with the ground. I would get a level and hold it against that red line.    The car seat is good (and pretty much the same as other snugrides) and highly recommended from multiple sources.    The click-connect is really nice and we can use the old bases we have.

I appreciated this, since I ended up pumping earlier than I'd intended to, due to the infant needing supplementation in the early days.  I'd started out with a pump provided by insurance. Once I ordered this system and started pumping, my output (on the same day I'd used the hospital pump)  doubled.  Definitely worth the investment if you need to maximize milk production.

Around the same time, I kept smelling a great cologne passing people on the sidewalk etc. For some reason I thought it was Calvin Klein, but when I checked at a store, I found I was wrong.<br /><br />Recently, by accident, I sprayed it on a card at a store, but didn't put it down right away when I realized my mistake. After a few moments, I caught another whiff of it. It was great and was the scent I had been trying to find all this time. What good luck. Not only that, but it is available at a good price all over.<br /><br />I got a bottle and use it often. A few sprays and I'm good to go. It lasts and lasts, but it is not overpowering. Great scent. I'm not good at describing scents, but I can say it is one of my favorites. On the heavier side as opposed to something light like citrus, but still not too much. Very masculine.<br /><br />Highly recommended.

11297	__label2__	5	Y	Toys	B004E9S8D4	Monster High Skullette Sensor Door Alarm	Cuter than I thought it would be	So I bought this simply to have a cute little skullette to set around not really expecting to use it. I was surprised at how cute it actually it. It is a decent size, about 3 1/2 inches across by 4 inches tall. The pink of the bow is painted on. Skullettes eyes are are made of red plastic and light up and flash at different speeds in perfect conjuction with the sound of the alarm. There are five different sounds: 1)Thunder, 2) a wolf howl, 3) loud buzzer, 4) school bell, 5)scream. This is pretty clever as it covers some of the monster themes, (thunder for frankie, wolf howl for clawdeen). It is loud and I imagine would have quite a "startle" effect on someone who did not know what it was. Like I said, I don't use it as an alarm but I love this little Skullette and I am glad I bought her!!

I had a set of sawhorses for about 15 years until my son borrowed them as he did a renovation project on his home. Needless to say they were junk when he got done. I picked a set of these up at a local Lowes and I made my son come over and cut a 2X4 to put a top on them for me. Payback! I have had them now for about 2 1/2 years and they are great.<br /><br />My favorite feature is that they fold up and store away and they take up a lot less space in my garage. I used them today and it just reminded me that I needed to post a review on them. They are strong and easy to set up and tear down. It seems like every project I do I get them out and use them. I like them a lot and I rate them at 5 stars.
11300	__label2__	5	N	Home	B0044DKUQS	Factory Direct Craft Mini Decorative Realistic Fall Pumpkins and Gourds - Pkg of 24	Perfect for fall decorating	These decorative pumpkins and gourds have become a staple in my fall decorating.  I put them out at the beginning of October and keep them until after Thanksgiving.  They are a perfect size - not too large so they take up too much space but not so small that they aren't noticeable.  You can display them in a group - I put mine on my fireplace hearth - or individually throughout the house.  You can even display them in a cornucopia.  You can display them inside or outside the house.  I've done both but like to keep them inside as they are so realistic looking that squirrels stole them from my front steps!
11301	__label2__	3	N	Beauty	B006RGMIT2	Gud Vanilla Flame Natural Body Lotion, 8 Fluid Ounces	A bit strong...	Although I like how thick and creamy this lotion is, I'm not a big fan of the scent. It is semi overpowering. It smells good, but it's just too much. As far as the lotion itself goes, it works really well, and it isn't greasy or slimy feeling. It's definitely good quality lotion, they just need to tone it down on the smelly part.

11303	__label2__	3	Y	Jewelry	B0085ROZYC	Navy Blue Heart Shape Cameo Ring Adjustable Band for Women	OKAY RING  -  Especially for the money.	as<br /><br />Honestly, there is more to like than not to like. I ordered this to wear as a pinky ring. It is a perfect size for that. It is adjustable, I like that. It appears to be well made for the money. The biggest thing I do not like is that it is SOOOOOO dark- the metal, the cameo -  everything. This makes for not much contrast, STILL WHAT CAN I EXPECT for the money.

His ex-wife has moved on with a restraining order barring him from seeing his daughter. Out of prison for less than a week he comes to the aid of a stripper (Alica Witt) and once again faces 10 years in jail.<br /><br />It is a pretty boring film. There is not much action and the drama left something to be desired.

I looked all over to find a sink repair kit in almond color. Lowe's, Home Depot, Orchard Supply & Ace Hardware DID NOT CARRY any sink repair kits in almond, only white. Its easy to apply & it sets in 24 hours. You don't need to buy Acetone or Lacquer Thinner for this project as it suggests. All you need is fingernail polish remover & Q-tips. After you put on as many layers as you need, 24 hours apart, you can sand the areas a bit to smooth the surface. Try not to go in too deep as you're sanding because then you'll have to add another coat of the sink repair liquid.
11307	__label2__	5	Y	PC	B009ZIILLI	Plugable USB Bluetooth 4.0 Low Energy Micro Adapter (Windows 10, 8.1, 8, 7, Raspberry Pi, Linux Compatible; Classic Bluetooth, and Stereo Headset Compatible)	Exceeded my expectaqtions in more ways than one	I purchased this on a whim because I needed to add a ten dollar plus item to qualify for super saver shipping on an order. I was always curious about these dongles, and the product started earning five stars before it even arrived. Shortly after placing my order the manufacturer sent me an email with a link to the latest drivers and software. That alone is an unusually high level of service.<br /><br />When this adapter arrived today, I had it up and running - and connected to a bluetooth speaker - in less than ten minutes. Step one was to install the drivers on the accompanying CD ROM (I could have downloaded them had I been diskless), then the software itself. The wizard stepped me though discovering the devices to which I wanted to connect and I was done. A great feature is when you connect to a speaker it appears as a headset and you have the option of hands-free operation or not.<br /><br />As an experiment I decided to check if my Samsung Galaxy Note 3 would connect. It did. Unlike when the adapter streams music to a speaker, I could move files from my phone to my laptop via bluetooth.<br /><br />For the record I installed this on an ancient ThinkPad T61 running Windows XP, SP3. No problems and no issues. The laptop immediately recognized it as a new piece of hardware as soon as I plugged it in.<br /><br />One final feature I love is I have this plugged into a port that is closely adjacent to a second USB port and there was sufficient clearance with both ports occupied.
11308	__label2__	1	Y	Home	B001NG9XJY	Chem-Dry Grease & Oil Stain Extinguisher – Specially designed to remove grease & oil based stains	Does nothing	I purchased this because it says it get rid of grease and oil. I put it to the test. My power chair broke a seal on the gear box and leaked 90 weight gear oil all over the carpet before i realized it. I followed the instructions to the letter. I let it set 30 seconds and then blotted it with a white towel. It removed nothing. I tried it several times and it didn't even faze the grease. I then used my carpet cleaner with solution and it barely did anything either. I then commence to use diesel fuel on the stain with a clean rag and it removed the entire stain. there were 10 gobs of grease and now they are all gone using diesel fuel without any harm to the carpet. This product is junk in my opinion and i won't ever buy again. What a waste of good money!<br /><br />update: I used my carpet cleaner again after using the diesel fuel and you can't tell the carpet was ever stained.

11310	__label2__	5	N	Electronics	B00945RAQY	Sony HTCT260 Sound Bar Home Theater System (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	I upgraded my HTCT100 and couldn't be happier - expansive sound, easy setup, and great price - Bluetooth a major bonus as well	Premium television sets used to advertise their screen size, image sharpness, and sound quality.  Not any more.  When you buy the latest LG, Sony, or any other LCD, LED, or Plasma display, the speakers are always on the back and very tinny with little bass response.  In short, the television manufacturers do not expect you to actually use the speakers in the TV.  Many diehard audiophiles will decide to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on stereo receivers hooked up to surround sound speakers.  For those with lots of money, space, and the time to set it up, these home theaters can be great.  For the rest of us, we want quality sound from our televisions that is compact and easy to setup.  This is the place where the Sound Bar really shines.<br /><br />There are many brands with some similarities - you typically get a long speaker to go under the TV itself, either on its own stand or mounted on the wall.  There is also a separate sub-woofer for deep noise response.<br /><br />This Sony HTCT260 was an upgrade to my existing Sony HTCT100.  Despite similar names, they are quite different.  To start, the Sony HTCT100 was a total of 250W of sound - three 50W speakers in the bar and a 100W subwoofer.  The Sony HTCT260 is 300W - two 85W front speakers and a 130W subwoofer.  Whether the front is two or three speakers is immaterial - they are all inside a single bar.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT100 had a subwoofer that plugged into the wall, and the audio from the source plugged into the subwoofer.  Then the Sound Bar plugged into the subwoofer with a proprietary cable.  That meant the subwoofer had to be near the sound bar.  However, it also meant that the subwoofer was a receiver in itself, with HDMI pass thru, analog input, and optical input.  HDMI pass-thru means you can plug your Blu-Ray player into the subwoofer, and then plug the subwoofer into the TV.  It had multiple HDMI inputs so the Sony HTCT100 could switch between sources.<br /><br />The Sony HTCT260 does away with the HDMI select capability - in fact, it doesn't have HDMI input at all, and the inputs are on the sound bar, not the sub-woofer.  The sub-woofer is a remote wireless device, so it can be placed anywhere, a major bonus.  It is shorter than the HTCT100 subwoofer, despite being more watts, is easier to conceal.  The only inputs are on the bar itself, consisting of Analog, Coaxial, and Optical.  Why did they make this change?  Consider my use of the HTCT100.  When I bought a TV that had networking capability, it meant that half the time I was using my TV, it was for content from the TV itself.  Since my TV had lots of HDMI inputs, it meant every device could also plug into the TV.  I eventually stopped using the HDMI passthrough and just plugged the optical out from my TV into the HTCT100.<br /><br />Since I assume most people have similar televisions now, the removal of the HDMI inputs and the wireless subwoofer of the HTCT260 makes sense.<br /><br />In terms of style, the sound bar is sharp looking, a little longer and wider than the HTCT100, and with a built-in display, it looks really good in my TV setup.  There are touch sensitive input select and volume buttons on the front, so you can adjust it even if you lose the remote control.<br /><br />Most important, how does it sound?  In a word, amazing.  I was dubious that the extra 50W would mean anything, but I found the sound far more immersive and expansive than with the HTCT100.  Previously on the HTCT100, I had actually hit the MAX and still thought the sound was too quiet for some sources, but now I can crank up the volume and actually get it too loud.  The bass is full and can be felt, but is not overpowering.  Simple "sound field" buttons on the remote allow you to adjust the effect for movies, games, or music.  With the subwoofer placed in the back of the room, I can achieve most of the surround sound effect without having to run wires and place tons of speakers.<br /><br />Finally, pairing the speaker with my iPhone via Bluetooth couldn't be simpler.  I hit "Pairing" on the remote, and about 30 seconds later I was blasting Tchaikovsky through the speakers from the iPhone.<br /><br />Highly recommended - I'm sure you could get better sound with a more expensive system, but bang for the buck, I am totally happy with this sound bar and highly recommend you get one to go with your new television set.

Original review with 5 stars:  I ordered the Solo 4900647-P 29-Inch Universal Stainless Steel Sprayer Wand And Shut-off Valve and when reading the reviews discovered that the nozzle that comes with the wand is non-adjustable.  I added this to the order and it fit perfectly and is a quality piece of equipment.  Unscrew the one that came with the wand and screw this on.  From jet to fan, I've got it all now.    3 months later with 3 stars:  The adjustment of this brass nozzle became more and more finicky and frustrating.  I don't know what changed.  Everything is clean, the filter screen, the nozzle, the works.  In frustration I ordered the "Solo 4900654-P Sprayer Elbow Nozzle Assembly Plus Standard Nozzle Assortment".  Much better.  We shall see how I feel about it after a time.  I figured metal is better than plastic, in this case that doesn't seem to be true.
11313	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B004VNJ0T4	The Day Lincoln Was Shot (Tvm)	A History of the Assassination	The Day Lincoln Was Shot, 1998 film<br /><br />Abraham Lincoln and his wife went to a play on Good Friday April 13, 1865. So did John Wilkes Booth. This is a history of that event. At the Surratt Boardinghouse men talk about politics. Booth conspires with his men about capturing Lincoln to exchange for Confederate prisoners. Will it work? Booth the actor has lady admirers, he dances in a ballroom. Lincoln is told he needs more security. Secretary of War Stanton arrives with news of the capture of Richmond. Lincoln wants to visit Richmond. He visits Secretary of State Seward who was injured in a carriage accident. Fireworks celebrate the victory. Lincoln asks the band to play “Dixie”, he plans to welcome the rebel states back. Mary Lincoln shows jealousy and spite. Abraham has a dream about his death. [Do people still believe in dreams?]<br /><br />Lincoln signs pardons for condemned Union soldiers. Lincoln’s son tells about his military experiences. Booth learns about the President’s planned visit to the theater that night and makes plans. Lincoln’s Cabinet recommends harsh punishment for the Rebel leaders, but Lincoln does not want more “bloody work”. They plan to reestablish the courts and the mail system. [Note the dirt roads.] Mrs. Surratt is asked to deliver a package. [This makes part of the conspiracy.] Booth breaks up with Lucy. The conspirators plan to strike at the same time. Lincoln and the Rathbones arrive late. The play goes on. Booth arrives at the theater, a man holds his horse. The other conspirators begin their crimes. There is confusion in the theater! Doctors treat Lincoln.<br /><br />Soldiers arrive. Lincoln is moved to the nearest house across the street. Booth’s leg was injured during his dramatic leap to the stage. Stanton order protection for the Cabinet, the city locked down, and everyone in the theater arrested. The doctors say Lincoln is doomed, he can not survive. Dr. Mudd says Booth’s fibula is broken, he must rest. Itrains in Washington. Lincoln dies at 7:22 AM. “Now he belongs to the ages.” Suspects are rounded up. Twelve days later the Garrett farm is surrounded. One soldier shoots Booth inside a burning barn (Booth shaved off his mustache as a disguise). “Useless” is his last word. The ending credits list what happened afterwards. Mary Surratt was hanged even though there was no conclusive proof of her guilt. [Her son escaped to Europe.] Dr. Mudd got four years as an accessory after the fact. Andrew Johnson became the 17th President, Reconstruction had a vindictive policy towards the South.<br /><br />The northern dominated Congress passed high tariffs on imports which increased industrialization in America. New laws liberalized corporations, they grew in power to form a new aristocracy. [Previously the privilege of incorporation and limited liability were only given to businesses that served the public interest, such as water companies, canals, and railroads.] This is a good history lesson but details had to be eliminated to make this movie fit into its allotted time period. You should read the book for the details that were omitted in this movie. What should be the Reconstruction policy? Harsh punishment for rebellion or a welcome for misguided politics? Machiavelli wrote the duty of a leader was not to chose between the good and the bad but between the bad and the worse; this is one example. You can’t please all of the people all of the time. Abolishing slavery punished the big landowners, those who financed the Confederacy would see their bonds worthless. “A rich man’s war but a poor man’s fight” was one description.

It's not perfect, but it's good.<br />It's best for XBMC or Media Player Classic.  Works well with VLC.  OK for general windows and browsing.  No keyboard.<br /><br />PROS:<br />* Infrared works in busy 2.4GHz areas<br />* Mouse joystick works fairly well<br />* Has full-screen button that works in media players, that's not on wireless keyboards.<br />* Cursor keys, enter, and backspace work in webpages and computer browser.<br />* Programmable hotkeys (edit the windows shortcut properties)<br />* Lasts a long time on a coin cell<br />* Very low price<br />* No driver required<br /><br />CONS:<br />* IR port doesn't stay put.  Needs grip tape, or to be a tiny fob.<br />* Mouse joystick is touchy, and should be slower with a light touch.<br />* Limited receiver angle, so it's hard to have set for both sides of the living room, AND from standing vs sitting.<br />* Would be nice to have a full keyboard on the other side (for a higher price of course).

11320	__label2__	3	N	Grocery	B003JUF2I8	Aunt Jemima Original Syrup 64 Ounce Mega Value Size Bottle	big jug	I honestly think a jug of maple syrup THIS humongous is unnecessary!  While it should be noted that Aunt Jemima doesn't really have the best waffles on the market (for some reason they're really chewy and tougher compared to the superior cheaper store brand ones- go figure!) an even bigger issue is that 64 ounces of maple syrup isn't even necessary for someone like me who lives alone.  It would take a really long time (and lots of waffle eating!) to get through this whole container of maple syrup.  Then again this stuff *does* tend to last a really long time in the cabinet doesn't it?  Many months!  That's pretty dependable.    However clearly 64 ounces of maple syrup is more appropriate for a family of 4 or more who eats pancakes and waffles regularly every morning.  Only appropriate for those families and not for people like me!  I'll just settle with the smaller jugs.  It's not like I use a lot of syrup anyway.  I never understood the fascination dumping as much syrup as you possibly can on your breakfast food.  Well then again I DID have this obsession as a kid in the 80's and used to dump more syrup than I should've on my pancakes and waffles until a few years ago when dentist appointments became routine.  Uh oh you know where I'm going with this!

It's powered by a cell phone charger and uses a SD card for its hard drive.  It has USB so you can plug in more storage, a keyboard, wifi dongle or more.  It has HDMI out, which will carry both audio and video as well as a normal audio headphone jack.  It has an Ethernet port so you can get it on the Internet and connected to your home network.  At the price point, it just can't be beat!<br /><br />I have one of my Raspberry Pi machines set up as a music server.  With a free iPhone app I can remotely connect to my Pi and stream music to my phone or to any Internet connected machine.  It is the gold standard for me, as I've always wanted a way to access all of my music on the go and this device pulls it off nicely.  It has enough power to read a FLAC file and convert it to a nice streamable MP3 on the fly, something that really impressed me.<br /><br />The Pi can also act as a very basic machine for those who just want something to surf the Internet.  It can be set up to stream videos over your network, but 720P seems to be the max here as 1080P video takes just a bit too much processing power.  While I haven't used it for this purpose yet, the Pi seems to be the new CPU of choice for people building retro arcade cabinets as the Pi seems to do a great job handing arcade game ROMs.<br /><br />The bottom line is the Raspberry Pi is a fun toy to play with and a valuable learning tool if you want to get under the hood and more involved with things like the Linux operating system.  It's low power enough to run it all the time and use it as a server and it's powerful enough to play Hi-Def 720P videos.  Buy one, you'll find a good use for it!

This is an excellent tool!<br />I was originally given a Craftsman Bolt-On as a gift about two years ago, and have since purchased or been given most of the different tools that go with it<br />Unfortunately, this summer, the motor on the Craftsman burned up. Sears/Craftsman said &#34;tough luck&#34; because they only offer a 1 year warranty. I've always been a Craftsman fan, but this combined with the lower price of the Matrix set led me to make the switch. Black & Decker gives a 2 year warranty and their batteries are actually compatible with other tools they make.<br />All of the attachments, the batteries and chargers are compatible between Craftsman and Black & Decker.<br />The size and cost of this set is its real advantage, compared to a set of similar tools. I can throw a drill driver, impact driver, oscillating sander, skill saw, reciprocating saw, jig saw and compressor in a small bag and carry it with me easily.<br />The strength of the batteries is impressive as is the charge time.<br />I got this particular drill in some freak sale of $20 + $7 shipping. As far as I can tell it is brand new and works flawlessly. It took two weeks to get but it was well worth it!

Perhaps ALS Group-Inc (etoolscity) have to do better packaging.<br /><br />But because of it I ordered similar item Titan 12047 1/2" drive 30" what is 5" longer breaker bar. This one I did receive in good condition and I'm pleased with this bar.

This game does play out alot like Contra.The graphics are REALLY good,especially for an NES game.The storyline was a bit weak I thought.I just don't understand how Joker can come to life,after being killed in the first game.For those of you that don't know,this is supposed to be a "sequel" to the first Batman "movie" NES game.It doesn't make much sense to me.Other than that.The music is good,along with the sound effects.The main problem I found with this game,was it was just too dang HARD.The first level is pretty easy to get through,but after that,it is VERY challenging.Give this game a try,only if you're a TRUE Batman fan and a HARDCORE gamer.
11327	__label2__	5	N	Books	1118846087	DSM-5 Essentials: The Savvy Clinician's Guide to the Changes in Criteria	Better priced than a day long professsional training.	Earlier, I took a day long training on the DSM V changes.  Many of us left rather confused and our heads were hurting.  I knew that I would need further training and reading.  Fortunately Reichenberg's book fits both of those requirements.  I like how well she breaks down the new DSM changes and provides insight as to the reasons for the changes and justifications along with some of the controversies.  I will still look for in-person trainings, but I don't think I will need the Excedrin too.

Low calorie it is not - fair warning. It packs a surprising caloric wallop in its little package. However the taste is excellent. I use this for a snack mid day afternoon and it is just perfect for me. I'm a triathlete so what I eat at 3pm is critical to the success of my after work workout. This fills me up, gives a great amount of carbs, does not feel hard to digest (so I feel heavy and bloated while running or swimming), and is easy to prepare. I love the texture and the nutty flavor. I'm a huge grain lover so this is right up my alley!

Nutty flavor	Quinoa has been used as a food in South America for more than 3,000 years and has grown in popularity and availability in the U.S. in the past few years.  It is an excellent plant source of protein, fiber, minerals, and B vitamins. It is also gluten-free.<br /><br />This quinoa from is of excellent quality, with no debris or defective grains, and it is clean even before rinsing.  It is organically grown on farms in the high Andes.<br /><br />Quinoa has a slightly nutty taste and it works well as a substitute for rice or couscous.  It cooks up faster than rice, which is convenient.  When cold, it makes a nice addition to a green salad.  It is especially good with a little olive, avocado, or nut oil drizzled on it.  It can even be sprouted before cooking.<br /><br />Soul Organics provided quinoa for evaluation and review.
11331	__label2__	5	N	Apparel	B00GBVXUU4	Haggar Men's Fitted Mechanical Stretch Long Sleeve Pattern Dress Shirt, Light Blue, 17.5(34/35)	Rethinking my opinion of Haggar...	So I have to say - historically I've stayed away from Haggar, as I always had this image of a rather staid, mass market company churning out barely-acceptable quality stuff.  But with the last two shirts I've tried from Haggar, I'm ready to eat crow.    This shirt has features that you don't typically find on shirts at this price point.  For example, you have gussets.  Gussets are small triangular pieces of cloth that sit at the intersection of the bottom hem and the side seam.  They are intended to strengthen this stress point, but you don't usually find them in mass market shirts because they are a pain to put in.  But Haggar has done so.    You have interlining in the collar.  Interlining is a separate strip of material sewn within the collar that gives it extra shape, crispness, and durability.  Again, it's kind of a pain to do it, but Haggar features it in this shirt.    Adding style is a horizontal bottom buttonhole in a contrasting thread.  Again, a nifty little detail that lots of shirtmakers don't bother with.    So this shirt is advertised as fitted, but I have to echo other reviewers in saying it's mostly fitted in name only.  There's a bit of taper but it's really not all that aggressive.  If you have a bit of a bay window you're still going to be fine in this shirt.  I did notice that the sleeve length is pretty much on target, so that tells me the cut of the armhole is slightly different between this fitted shirt and the Haggar regular fit cut.  A raised armhole, as in the regular fit, helps keep the shirt from being too restrictive but it tends to shorten the effective length of the sleeve.  In this case, a fitted cut wants to hug the body a bit more, so the armhole is lower.  I have both cuts and don't have much of an issue with either in the Haggar shirts.  This is probably the biggest clue that even though the shirts offer specialized features like gussets and interlining, the overall cuts still tend to the mass market.    The material is somewhatthin, so call this a summerish weight.  It's a nice material though and doesn't look like it will wrinkle too easily.  Overall I'm quite pleased with this shirt.
11332	__label2__	4	Y	Furniture	B00DF075BY	Cosco Blossom 4 Bin Storage Unit, Pink/White	This is great for a child's room	This is great for a child's room, and make sure they use it for light items. I am a 30 year old female and I bought one , because I am developing OCD badly, I been with my husband for 6 1/2 years and his mom has it and for the past few years I been organizing constantly, So, my husband has been buy bins, not the cheap plastic expensive ones. Ones that hold up with metal racks, they are more sturdier. This was easy to put together but at times when pulling out the drawer the metal brackets come undone or the plastic liner that you put 2 each for each square to keep the drawer in that space. But over all its good for children or a adult who wants to store small items. That is why I gave it a 4. I also like the face I can out pictures of family in the flowers, I have on one, my husband and me on our wedding day, then our oldest child who is 8, then our 7 year old and last but not least our 3 month old. But I would think about buying another one for the baby, since my 2 older children cant take care of anything. We bought the 4 drawer plastic at wal-mart and they over filled it, took the drawers out stepped on it and broke it which those cost 25-30 dollars. My husband and I are liking the fabric kind you cant store a little more heavy stuff depending on which one you buy like I said before , be care putting heavy items in this storage unit,
11333	__label2__	4	N	Sports	B008EQ1LMS	Elixir Golf Sun Protection Arm Cooling Sleeve-1 Pair, White	Low cost.  Works fairly well.	Low cost.  Very stretchy.  They block sun well enough for all-day riding.  As a reminder, these are not magic.  The cooling effect is:<br />A) Reflection of sunlight.  If you're not wearing white ones, they will absorb sunlight and get hot.<br />B) Evaporative cooling.  If you are not sweating, and there is no airflow, then you will feel warm.<br /><br />I'm 197cm (6'5&#34;) tall.  My biceps are 13.5&#34; and my forearms are 12&#34; in circumference.  From armpit to wrist on the inside is 25&#34;.  I find that these sleeves end up settling to about 16.5 inches long on my arms.  That leaves about 1/2 inch between my longest cycling jersey and these; plus there is a gap of 2-3 inches from my glove line to these.  I can stretch to cover more, but that's what they retract to over time.<br /><br />They are like thin, stretchy socks, so if you have an agitator post in your washer, these could get hung up.  I usually just put a little dish soap on them and do a quick scrub in the kitchen sink every 2-3 rides, and make sure they are laid out to dry in the heat after a ride.  That being said, I've had no problems running them through the laundry.

11335	__label2__	5	N	Home Entertainment	B00TYFCJ8S	Sony BDPS3500 Blu-ray Player with Wi-Fi (2015 Model)	Offers A Lot For The Money	This is an awesome Blu Ray player.  It has almost everything you would need.  I had no issues connecting to my Actiontec router.  I am on Verizon Fios 50/50 and my streaming quality was very good.  Movies loaded fast on Amazon and Netflix.  The Sony uses the Opera TV store, so even though there are lot of apps available, they are all sort of like misfit apps.  All the good ones are printed on the box.  The main ones are all there.  You get WWE Network, Netflix, Hulu, Amazon., Flixster, Vudu, Youtube, Etc.  There is NO HBO GO or FIOS Mobile TV app.<br /><br />There was a quick update, and initialization.  It took about 10 minutes to set everything up.<br /><br />The Sony is also unique in that it can stream Playstation 3 games via the Playstation Now app.  A subscription is required, and costs about $20 a month for unlimited play on a growing list of 100 games.  You can also rent games daily, but you are better off with the monthly.  They have a lot of good games, such as The Last of Us, Lego Batman, Street Fighter, and more.<br /><br />Games loaded fairly quickly.  Every time you load a game, it does an internet connection to make sure you can stream it.  Once it streams, and you are up and running it feels just like playing on the PS3/PS4.  I could not tell a difference playing on this Blu-ray player with the PS Now app compared to the PS4 in terms of graphic quality.  They both looked similar.  Your PS Now subscription will work with your PS3, PS4, and PS TV also, but you can only stream games on one device at a time.<br /><br />The Dual Shock 4 controller works with this.  However, it MUST be connected via USB in order to work.  There is no Bluetooth compatibility built into the player.  You can also use the Dualshock to control the functions of the player too.<br /><br />The Sony also has miracast capabilities.  I was able to use my Android phone and mirror every time I saw on my screen.  This is awesome because the Opera TV store does NOT have Verizon Fios Mobile TV.  With the miracast function, I can mirror the Fios Mobile on my phone to the Sony.  This allows me to use the Sony as an extra cable TV box.<br /><br />The Sony is small and boxy.  It looks like a miniature PlayStation.  It has the same finish and color.<br /><br />Oh, it also plays Blu-rays.  It loads quickly and is pretty silent.  There is also a small green light to let you know if it is on or off.<br /><br />All in all, this Sony Blu-Ray offers you a lot for the money.  I highly recommend it.

My daughter always has a drink and the cup doesn't fit correctly I this.<br /><br />The whole mix & match thing is not my cup of tea. This should include a sunshade. My stroller cost just as much as this seat. It came with a large basket and a sunshade.<br /><br />While the seat itself is nice, it's not affordable for the average household. There's too many things I don't love about this stroller to fork out that kind of money.

But why trash a perfectly good timepiece that had proven itself to be so reliable since I had purchased it new here back in 2008? As they say, "It takes a licking and keeps on ticking."      Started searching for a decent 20mm sports watchband that was reasonably priced and not designed to look [[ASIN:B005BKPS9C too weird]] on my watch, as are some of them. Maybe I'm too conservative, but there were [[ASIN:B002Z367CK some]] that just weren't my style. Contemplated a stainless steel link band, such as this [[ASIN:B001EYVBAY Hadley-Roma Men's 20-mm Stainless Steel Watch Bracelet]], but had to rule it out as I didn't know how it would look on my old favorite watch.      By chance I found this [[ASIN:B003U98VHC AllStrap 20Mm Black Sport Leather-Contrast Stitch Watchband]] and it seemed to be a decent choice, though it was called a long length band in the specs, and I have an average wrist. Still, it's better to have one a bit long than too short, and considering that the price was reasonable, ordered it here. When it arrived a couple of days later (and thanks, Amazon Prime), took it out of the package and looked it over. It did indeed have a 20mm band width, came with a pair of replacement stainless steel spring bars, and easy to see that it was black leather... but it appeared to be a slightly different product from the one here in the photos. The end wasn't pointed as is shown in Voguestrap's product photos, but more of a squared end sport strap similar to that on the [[ASIN:B001F0PTPK Hadley-Roma Men's MSM881XA-200 20-mm Black Oil-Tan Leather Watch Strap]], if their image is correct.      The other thing that was different was that the band is slightly padded, and not flat, and the buckle is not the shiny one as pictured. The one that I received had a brushed steel look, as one can see in the photos that I've posted here.      Allsaid and done, I like this band more than the one that's there in Voguestrap's product photos. But it does serve as a reminder to all of us to check the specs carefully before ordering a product.

I'm writting the review mostly because I saw several reviews talking about the size of this thing and hopefully I can help someone (when I first bought it the dimensions were not specified, I see now that the vendor has clarified it).  This one has a 1 1/2&#34; diameter, that is the thread diameter (the size of the hole on your DE filter, the one you take off to let the water inside the filter completely drain out and so you can wash any sand deposits at the bottom of your filter).  The size of the cap is just over 2&#34;, but that shouldn't matter to you, what you need to make sure is that the size of the hole is the same size as the thread on this thing.<br /><br />Mine is actually 2&#34; size, so this cap is actually too small.  On the positive side though, the o-ring is very flexible so I couldn't use the cap, but I could still use the o-ring (though I would recomend you get the right 2&#34; o-ring because by stretching it that much I would guess it will last a lot less than the right O-ring).  I've tried with a lot of teflon tape and you really do need the o-ring to stop all leaks.

Now I wish I had bought them sooner.<br /><br />I use the slim spatula every morning when I make eggs. I love the slotted spoon for making pasta, the ladle is great for soups and stews, the pasta spoon, larger spatula and non-slotted spoon are wonderful. These fit nicely in my utensil holder, and I love that they are weighted. I can set them down at any time and not worry that I am getting pancake batter on the counter and that I am not soiling my spoon with anything that might be on the stove.<br /><br />They feel good in my hand and even after lots and lots of use, the colors are bright and the surfaces aren't scratched or burnt.<br /><br />My one single complaint is that in the smaller spatula, water seems to gather inside it when in the dishwasher. If I forget to drain it, I'll get dishwasher water in the thing I am cooking when I use it. And that kind of sucks, you know? But it wasn't enough to not keep the set and doesn't outweigh the pros.

11357	__label2__	5	N	Outdoors	B00WA1SUEK	Lightess Rechargeable Zoomable LED Headlamp Cree XM L2 5 Modes Head Lamp Lights Head Torch LED Light for Camping, Hunting, Hiking.	This Headlamp Rocks	[[VIDEOID:c2df505db83f0cbd75f4a819155d06ef]]Do you want Power more than anything else from your headlamp? At anywhere near this price, this is it. Let me tell you about this headlamp, and I purchased my first one just like this one six months ago, so I know about them.    You're going to get a reasonably comfortable band, that can be improved on by wearing an athletic  headband under it. I think that it will adjust to anybody's head on this third rock from the sun and it works well.    On the back of it, is the power pack containing two, included 18650 batteries. I did a capacity test on them and they were measured at about 1200mAh, so the two will last quite a while, 3-5 hours or more on Low, but I'm using two 3100mAh in mine that test at over 3200mAh and now it really lasts.    This pack includes a USB port to charge it or any other device that you charge USB, and this comes with a wall charger for the pack too, so it arrives ready to charge and use. The pack has a rubber cover to pull off to insert the batteries and it stays attached by a little ring, so you won't drop or misplace it.    On the front is the lamp and it's got a magnifying lens. This lamp is what really rocks about this, it uses a good, white XM-L2 LED with a lot of output. I've never owned a more powerful headlamp and this will provide daylight at about 75 feet. It will also provide a huge, bright flood of light at 25 feet. You'll twist the ring on the light like a camera zoom, for magnification.    This uses a 5 setting switch with memory and you will need to click this one to cycle through them. It's High-Medium-Low-Strobe-SOS, and if you're on Medium and shut it off, it will remember to turn back on Medium, unless you don't wait long enough, in which case it would then cycle to Low.    This is very wide magnification that this lens is using, so it won't shine quite as far as my fixed lens flashlights like it, but this is still so much light that you will like this lamp, guaranteed.    Everything about this is okay, except that I really wish that they would have made the tilt more adjustable, you'll get four positions with three usable. These batteries work fine but you'll like it even better with an upgrade to higher rated ones. You might not get more than half a phone charge from these batteries, unless they are fully charged, and of course they won't power the light as long either. I'm using [[ASIN:B00O9XLOW2 These Batteries]], which cost more than the light does today, but it's 6400 vs 2400mAh and I could top off my phone twice and still have hours of light. 18650 batteries will recharge 500 times, so expensive batteries are cheap in the long run, it will depend on how often you charge them, but maybe only $2 a year. It's something to consider, mainly if you do want to charge a device from this or will use the headlamp where you can't charge it again for days.    Now after owning two of these headlamps, I love them twice as much. There are a few nits to pick, but this kind of Power at this price, fagetta bout it.    Recommended    This product was sent to me to test and review for you online shoppers.

11361	__label2__	5	Y	Lawn and Garden	B000AQNQ4Q	Solo 420 2-Liter One-Hand Pressure Sprayer	Best pressure sprayer I've used	I've had several different sprayers over the years.  This so far is my favorite.<br /><br />It is well built and sturdy.  The extendable arm allows me to reach high into the trees, etc, or to reach down to the ground without reaching or bending.  The spray adjuster is easy, just twist the deflector cup at the end of the rod to go from mist to solid spray.  And the deflector cup is a really nice feature.  If you are spraying a dandelion, for example, the cup actually can be placed over the weed and then give it a quick squirt.<br /><br />The 'on-off' button is not instantaneous so realize that it won't stop the spray as soon as you let off the button.  Not a problem, just a note.

I have about 4 of these things and recommend them to my clients.

Since I had nothing to lose, I decided to try it on this device and while it struggled, it did eventually read the data and allow access.  The dual 3.5 and 2.5 drive size capabilities makes these units winners!  Great for cloning drives and accessing information off of older SATA.
11363	__label2__	4	N	Camera	B00A927W9G	TRENDnet Wireless N Pan, Tilt, Zoom Network Cloud Surveillance Camera with 1-Way Audio and Night Vision, TV-IP851WIC (White)	Nice full featured security camera	I already have the older Trendnet wireless camera that is just a straight cam with no pan/tilt/zoom for several years which have been very stable and dependable on my wifi network.<br /><br />To the new PTZ Trendnet camera, first off, set up was incredibly easy! I plugged in to the network then plugged the power in. I used NMAP to scan for the device and found the IP. Entered the IP into the browser then it went through the steps to setup. During the setup flow, a step will ask you to create a username and password for cloud access, this will let you access the camera from anywhere in the world.<br /><br />The monitoring page is nice, it gives you an option to use Active-x or Java. Controls are a bit laggy but not horrible. Picture quality is decent, but the Zoom option of the camera is full optical zoom which doesn't work very well. I've played with cameras that had awesome zoom, but the price point is alot higher.<br /><br />The camera makes alot of noises when panning, I wish it was a bit quieter.<br /><br />There are more features on this camera that I have not delved into that I plan on doing soon, but for now, I got the camera working well, so far it has been very stable.<br /><br />My total camera setup at home is 3 Foscams and 2 Trendnets. So far, I have have been happy with the Foscams after plenty of adjustments, if the Trendnet was a bit cheaper, I would most likely convert all to Trendnet as my original Trendnet cam have been super stable.

Update: I got the turn signals working and found that these lights are wired incorrectly internally.  Instead of varying the intensity of the light output they go dark instead of flashing.  Another brand of light works correctly.
11367	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B003O7T87C	DōMatcha  Green Tea, Organic Summer Harvest Matcha, 2.82oz Tin	DaMatcha took me back to Japan!	I've attended many traditional tea ceremonies, including ones in Japan. In the tea house I went to in Kyoto there was a tea class that explained how to properly prepare matcha. If you are looking for tea to create an authentic ceremony then I would highly recommend this tea. When I prepared this tea it brought me back to the tea house in Kyoto. I would prepare this tea for guests, exchange students, conducting a ceremony, and when teaching about Japanese culture.<br /><br />At Japanese tea ceremonies the most important thing is the green tea. Ceremonial tea grade matcha is the highest quality powdered green tea. When you open the container you can see and smell the quality. When I opened this package I could tell that the matcha was great quality. The smell wasn't bitter, but lightly sweet, and it smelled like grass. The power is fine, soft, and pure green. It did not stick to the package sides and slide easily out into the cup. The taste is a mixture of slightly bitter and similar to barley. It also has a unique flavor itself that I can only describe as matcha itself.<br /><br />When you make green tea from powder you need to consider how to make it properly. A cup that is shaped like a bowl is appropriate for traditional ceremonies, and you would need a bamboo whisk to stir the powder and water. It should froth at the top while you whisk, and after you whisk. If you like stronger tea then the entire pouch is good for one cup, but if you don't like strong tea then only use half of it. The water shouldn't be boiling hot, but just before the boiling point. If it is too hot it will take away from the flavor, and if it is too cold it will be extremely bitter and clump together. If you're just drinking this in a regular mug you should be cautious with how strong you are making the matcha, and stir it with a regular utensil. Make sure to stir thoroughly so that you don't leave any clumps in the cup.<br /><br />When drinking this tea you should finish it in one sitting. If you let the tea become cold it will increase in bitterness and become unpleasant. It is rude to not finish a cup of tea during a traditional ceremony, and the last sip should be a long one. If you haven't attended a ceremony but want to prepare one I suggest watching a video first because there are many steps to making the perfect cup of tea. The cup, whisk, scooper, kettle, and tea can make the difference in preparation for a ceremony. With this tea it is important to have the other components be top quality to enjoy the tea at its best.<br /><br />This grade of tea doesn't need anything added but water. You shouldn't add sugar to this tea, or lemon, or anything else. If you think it is too bitter then you should eat sweets while drinking it. Youkan is the traditional Japanese bean paste sweet to have with matcha. The sweets will curve the bitterness and make the experience more enjoyable.<br /><br />If you are wanting to make green tea ice cream I suggest staying with this brand, but consider using a lower grade of tea. It still works with ceremonial grade, but it seems like a waste to use such high quality tea for something else. Adding some powder on top of vanilla ice cream tastes amazing. There are more uses for green tea than just drinking it, though with this grade of green tea the best way is to drink it.

Initial Review:<br /><br />Honestly, I have never heard of Minoura Bicycle Trainers until just recently. I have never seen this brand at the stores I have shopped at.

I understand these two trainers are not in the same league and same design, but my initial reaction to this trainer is good.<br /><br />Positives:<br />- Easy setup.<br />- Good solid build and lighter weight.<br />- Remote control for the adjusting the tension.<br />- Excellent skewer locking design.<br />- Included riser block.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />- No feet height adjustments.<br /><br />I will take this for a ride this weekend and I will update my review regarding performance and noise levels compared to a fluid trainer.

After using these for a year/half, can do an actual review on these.<br />Very accurate in the frequency range, linear and detailed even at low volume [as with headphones and earbuds]<br /><br />&#34;Near Field&#34; monitors are a strange type of speaker that can be used  the same way as headphones, quiet but still very audible at near zero volume levels and can get as loud as regular speakers. I've tested this, at a certain distance family couldn't even hear the output until increasing volume past a certain threshold.<br /><br />I've tested the klipsch too, and those are definitely not near field speakers. They can go to low volumes as well, but the bass response is very, very audible even at lower volumes. The treble for those is simply too much treble as well, slightly piercing at a moderate volume level.<br />I check my beats on them sometimes to see how they translate across different equipment etc.<br /><br />I would classify klipsch as [Far Field] due to design and sound signature.

I found it hard to believe that anything could be as good as she said. Then one Christmas her sisters got together and sent her a box of these Butterscotch Krimpets. I tried them and I immediately fell in love with them. The smooth, creamy butterscotch flavored frosting is delightfully sweet and tasty. And the light yellow cake is moist, fluffy, and also rich in flavor. Tastykakes are definitely superior to the other brands.

11382	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B003O6CB6S	Call of Duty: Ghosts - PC	It's awesome -- but don't expect to run it on your mom's 8-year-old Celeron notebook!	I really don't know what the reason is for all the hate for this game, but I think it's awesome.  However, I can guarantee you that you're not going to think it's awesome if your PC isn't up to specs.<br /><br />I've been a PC gamer since Wolfenstein, Doom, etc, so I started the COD series with...COD -- the original!  I've bought every COD game since then, and at times, yes, they ran horribly for me, but that was my fault for being a cheapo and not upgrading my system.  Sometimes, you just have priorities in life other than keeping the latest, greatest hardware in your PC, but when that happens you really shouldn't hate on the latest game(s) simply because you have an inadequate system.  Again, i want to emphasize -- I know.  I've been there.  I try to string along my PC hardware as long as I possibly can.  For the last six years I've been using a dual core in a MediaPC case that used to be my homemade DVR before I went with DirecTV.  I wasn't able to play the original Black Ops at all or even World at War.  All the Modern Warefare titles worked at mediocre (or less) settings.  Recently I decided it was time for a long past-due upgrade, so I built a Core i7-4770 based system with 16GB RAM, a GTX 660 w/2GB GDDR5, and Windows 7 x64.  Not the fastest/latest, but not a slouch system by any means.  It plays COD Ghosts at maximum everything video related as if it was a CGI movie.<br /><br />I'm a little disappointed that the solo missions aren't there like in the MW titles, but I haven't really looked into all the multiplayer options, so there may be something in there that will entertain me after the campaign.<br /><br />In regard to all the one-star reviews, I guess I should thank you, as I highly suspect that's why the price was already lowered by $10 for this game when I bought it.  It's simple, folks -- update your system or don't buy the latest and greatest games and expect to play that with a maxed out configuration.  Welcome to PC gaming.  This isn't a gaming console that never needs upgrading.<br /><br />Edit:  They lost a star from me because there are no solo missions other than zombies, which I don't care for at all.
11383	__label2__	4	N	Beauty	B00A0J0ABK	Dove Men+Care Post Shave Balm, Sensitive Plus 3.4 oz	Welcome relief for the modern man	Once upon a time, when razors were two disposable blades on the end of a plastic stick and shaving foam was the consistency of the head on a day old glass of beer, after shave balms and lotions were one of my grooming necessities. Over the years, as actual shave product technology improved, I found I had less need to use after shave products. Now that I'm older, and presumably wiser, I have begun to recognize the benefits of soothing and calming the skin after shaving, and have found that a good balm or lotion will do wonders for skin quality and overall appearance. So I welcomed the opportunity to try this Dove post shave balm for men.<br /><br />I don't have a regular shaving routine. Some days I go with [[ASIN:B0032ANCUK Edge Shave Gel, Extra Protection, 7-Ounce Cans (Pack of 6)]] and my [[ASIN:B001G7PTVQ Gillette Mach3 Disposable, Sensitive, 3-Count (Pack of 2)]], some days [[ASIN:B00A0J086C Axe Shave Gel, Shield, 7 Ounce]] takes the place of the Edge, and some I use my [[ASIN:B005DKKBRY Panasonic ES-LT41-K Men's 3-Blade (Arc 3) Wet/Dry Rechargeable Electric Shaver with Nanotech Blades, Black/Silver]], maybe wet with gel, but usually dry. It's just how I feel at the moment. I found that this Dove product works fine no matter what shave method I've used, but it was particularly soothing on dry skin after a dry electric shave. A little goes a long way and when massaging it in, you can almost feel like it is soaking into the skin. It is just oily enough to allow it to be spread out across the face, but once the application is complete, it air dries quickly, leaving skin (sounds like a commercial) soft and smooth. The scent is slightly effeminate, I felt, but it isn't particularly strong and doesn't linger very long after application. I used this balm in tandem with [[ASIN:B00A0J09GG Axe Face Hydrator and Post Shave Gel, Chilled, Cooling, 3.3 Ounce]]and I think it leaves my skin just a little less greasy (but the Axe product is fine too). A similar product is the [[ASIN:B009YSSLGE Dove Men+Care Hydrate + Face Lotion]], which I use when I'm going to be out in the sun or on days when I don't shave (which are usually the same day).<br /><br />I really like this Dove post shave product. There's a great chance I will continue using it for the foreseeable future.

I use this primarily for the time, date, temperature display and for that it works great. The instructions are very easy to follow. I have tested out all the features and some work great while others are a mixed bag. -Time/date. Very straight forward and the orange glow through the wood is great. The snooze button dims the display which is normally the setting I have it on. Note: the dot in the upper left corner of the time display means pm. -Temperature. I find this to be pretty accurate but it does depend where the back of the block is facing, for example if it's facing a window it will likely not be an accurate reading of the room temperature. The directions say it can be up to two degrees off. -Alarms. These work consistently fine and are fairly easy to set. -Speaker. The bluetooth is automatically on when plugged in and will show up when searching for devices on your portable device. To shut the bluetooth off you hold the call/pause button down for 3 seconds. Sound quality wasn't the best I've ever heard but it was decently loud and much better than expected. If you are looking primarily for a bluetooth speaker I would look elsewhere though. There is also an aux in for devices that don't have bluetooth. -Wireless charger. Even without a case on this won't charge my phone and appears to be faulty. Do not buy for the wireless charging aspect. For me this isn't a deal breaker as there is a usb plug in for charging and I have found most of these wireless chargers to be slow and unreliable. -Usb plug in. You can plug in your charging cable to this and it charges fine and eliminates the need to plug in a wall charger. This makes up for the wireless charger in my opinion.  Build quality seems good and sturdy and the product has a good weight. One thing to note is that the product is a bit larger and wider than I expected and does take up my whole night table. The product measure about 9&#34;x 5.5&#34;x 2.5&#34;. Overall super unique and I recommend it even if all the features aren't up to par. HOWEVER I want to make it clear that if you are purchasing this it would be for looks (which I personally think looks awesome) not so much for features. The clock/date/temperature display works great and that is primarily what I got it to use for. There is no radio and this product is not advertised to have a radio.
11386	__label2__	4	N	Furniture	B005ETZIMM	basyx by HON VL103 Mid-Back Leather Executive Task Chair for Office or Computer Desk, Black	Sleek look, upright chair for back support, but this is not an ergonomic chair..	In my old job, we would have to undergo ergonomic training and testing and we were given the best ergonomic seats of the time.  And since then, I have been trying out different chairs that are stylish, not too expensive but most of all, provides comfort and good back support.  If I can find an ergonomic office chair for a low price, I would be happy but most of the time, anything within the $50-$200 range are typically straightforward chairs.<br /><br />This leads me to the latest office chair that I am using in the office...the basyx VL103 by Hon.<br /><br />I.  INSTALLATION<br /><br />Installation was easy.  Actually, I came home and my wife already had put it together and she said it took her less than half an hour.  I did notice that when it came in, the chair came with the original toolset but also came with a newer revised tool-set that was affixed to the top of the box. So, there must have been a revision to this chair.<br /><br />II.  STYLE<br /><br />I love the look of the basyx VL103.  Leather seat (not thick leather), chrome stands and also under the arm rest area and because of the way it looks and it's not all plastic, is probably why it's close to $150 (on Amazon).  It's very sleek and of the several office chairs that I have owned, this is the best looking one that I have had so far.<br /><br />III.  COMFORT & EASE OF USE<br /><br />Upon putting it together, you have one lever that adjusts the up and down movement and there is a tilt tension, so you can pull the lever out and tilt it to become upright and lock or for those who want to adjust the tilt of the chair.  But this is not an ergonomic seat, so you can't adjust the back, nor can you adjust the seat to move it up or curved.  But there is good enough padding on the seat area and really good support for the mid-back.<br /><br />This is important to know because typically, for an office chair around $100 or so, the back seat is not upright and they are not as durable.  This one makes you sit in agood posture and that's what I enjoy about it so far.  Granted, I still want an ergonomic chair that I can always adjust (especially long hours of working) but many of them are expensive.  For this seat at under $150, it's great in mid-back support and having you sit in a straight position.<br /><br />And the caster wheels work good.  I use a mat around my desk area and am able to move freely.<br /><br />IV.  JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />One of the difficult things about purchasing an office chair online is that you want to sit on one before buying.  It's important as all chairs are subjective to the one using it.  But I can say that this is not a cheap chair with mesh backing, nor is it a chair with a flimsy back support.  For it's price and it's style, it's definitely worth it at the under $150 price point.<br /><br />With that being said... For those who suffer from back problems, you probably want to look for an ergonomic seat but you're going to have to pay a little more for it (see [[ASIN:B004LQ1URQ Office Star WorkSmart Professional Dual Function Ergonomic High Back Eco Leather Chair, Black]] or if you want the best and are willing to pay over $500 (see [[ASIN:B003Y5BF7A ErgoHuman Executive Chair with Headrest in Black]]).  Also, note that there are ergonomic chairs sold on Amazon that are cheaper than this chair, but they tend to break easy (the lever or pivots, so beware of cheap ergonomic office chairs).<br /><br />But if you need one that will force you to sit in a good posture but also feels comfortable especially around the mid-back, and most importantly, won't hurt your pocketbook, the basyx VL103 by Hon is worth considering!

The right button seems contextual, but it brings up the additional menu options that I get when I long press a song or soft-button.n  Left and bottom buttons act as the typical selection click.  I haven't noticed any particular power drain from this, so I suspect it may be a lesser milliamp pull than a typical wired USB mouse.    Does rattle about quite a bit, but as long as that trackball isn't pinching my skin like trackballs of yore, I don't care.  :)    - Complimentary product provided for evaluation, and would so buy again.

11390	__label2__	4	Y	Outdoors	B009PWE6RW	NEW 3800lm 3x Cree Xm-l T6 Led Outdoor Headlight Headlamp Bicycle / Bike Light	Great light, very bright and good price. Don't believe the specs though.	As most people have said, this is a very bright light. It's also a lot smaller than it looks. I haven't timed the run-time on it yet -- but also haven't had it run down unexpectedly.<br /><br />The headlamp band works... but battery placement is awkward when worn on the head... I put the battery pack in my shirt pocket.<br />It's mostly worn on my bike though.<br /><br />The strobe is often mentioned as useless in reviews... but it's intended to be used in daylight to make the biker more visable.<br /><br />FYI: I bought the 6 cell 6600mha battery pack for it also, but the connector isn't an exact fit. The connector works, but doesn't snap tight. A little tape would fix the problem - and to be fair, they don't really claim to be compatible.<br /><br />Also, take all of the Specs on the light and the battery with a grain of salt: If these are Cree Xm-l lamps, they are rated at a max  of<br /> 1000 lumens per bulb  (for a total potential of 3000 lumens -- not 3800) consuming 10 watts per bulb. Also, despite the claim of 6400 mAh battery pack, a typical 18650 Li-on cell is 2300-2600 mAh -- so 4 cells (2 groups of 2 in series to produce 8.4 volts) would give you closer to 4600-5200 mAh. At that rate a 30 watt load / an ave voltage of (2*3.5v) would give a current draw of 4.29 amps (4290 ma) so the supplied battery pack should last about an hour with the light on &#34;high&#34;.<br /><br />It's a great light at a great price, I docked it one star because of the bogus specs -- but don't let that deter you.
11391	__label2__	5	N	PC	B00FFVYSE8	Dell Venue 7 16 GB Tablet (Android)	Great tablet - (I wanted it mine for .cbr files as well as other multimedia demands)	I've been slow to pick up a new tablet after purchasing one a few years back, finding that initial exposure disappointing. A couple of months ago I did get  a new one for my wife, and after playing with hers for a little while I decided I needed one of my own.<br /><br />I'm really, really glad I got this model. I like it enough that I'm going to purchase another as a gift for family. With the holidays fast approaching, it would be a good addition for application use. My mother wants something that streams for shopping and watching videos and for applications like the bible online, and she also wants games. This handles all those well, plus it is easy to  use even if a person isn't so computer savvy.  The device is durable, lightweight, and you can see it well on bright days.I always hated not being able to do that - what's the point otherwise? It loads fast, processes well, and has all the user-friendly features I would want. You can easily access the menus, change settings, place applications or widgets where you want. The picture quality is great, coming in  above my expectations, and the sound is nice. Accessing files from the SD card is easy, with everything loading fairly quickly. When you look at the price, it well surpasses others in the range too.<br /><br />And battery life - that's been good.<br /><br />Battery life has always been a sticking point with others, because they die so easily. This one, with features you can tinker with to save more energy, lasts a good deal longer than I expected. If I play games it burns it faster, but when I'm reading in the day or travelling and wanting to use it, it holds up well. The device charges decently fast too, which is pretty nice.<br /><br />One thing I really wanted for myself was something that could easily read .cbr files (comic books) and .pdf files so I could carry them on the go. I have a Kindle but  Kindles have an issue with that; they put borders around comics if you convert them yourself, making it tiny. Even when you add applications, they have yet to handle it well. This does a great job with them. I use Comicrack since I've used them for a long time and Foxit PDF for my PDF files; there are other programs but these do a great job.<br /><br />Very pleased with this item!
11392	__label2__	5	N	Jewelry	B00K06VI9Q	King Will Tungsten Ring Matte Brushed Center Grooved Beveled Polished Edge 8mm Men's Wedding Band(11.5)	King Will 8mm Men's Brushed Center Tungsten Ring - Polished edges - Excellent ring - Recommended	Neither of my guys are jewelry wearers... they are car guys. My spouse lost the original 18k gold wedding band that I had designed for him (lost in the depths of a sand volleyball court); he lost the 14k replacement I bought for him after that; and he lost the 10k replacement's replacement that I made HIM buy.<br /><br />No watches. No necklaces. He's just not that guy.<br /><br />Our teenage son takes after his dad...<br /><br />But these rings from King Will look like stuff they both wear, looks like they could have been made from the metals in the tools and car parts they play with, so I got one to test the waters and he loved it. Am very glad that I did, and now we are back for a couple more.<br /><br />This particular ring is classy looking, though much more like a traditional wedding band in shape, color and design. Still, it is different enough that he is not complaining about it and even says that it looks nice. so far the King will ring that he likes the best is ([[ASIN:B00F0HFQO8 King Will Men's Tungsten Black Carbon Fiber Inlay]]), but they all look great on him.<br /><br />Awesome band-style look. Smoothed edges for comfort. Nice hefty weight (about 16 grams or about 6/10ths of an ounce, per our postal scale). I like this ring and I like it on him.<br /><br />As an aside, the gift box is one of the nicest little boxes I have seen so I will be keeping it for use with my own rings.<br /><br />While the Amazon listing notes that this ring is covered by a "100% Money Back within 14 days Guarantee", the ring comes with a "Service Commitment Card" that notes "Happy customers mean the world to us" while providing an email address and telephone number to call if there are any problems, promising "a full refund or exchange for a new one". To us, that is an excellent commitment to customer satisfaction that we hope never to need to use... but if we do, I would return to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this awesome ring gratis from the seller and, after trying it, my husband is no longer objective about it at all... he really likes the rings from this company. My statements here reflect that testing and his sentiment.<br /><br />If you are looking for a ring for your guy, one of this color, price, style and construction, then this ring might be exactly what you are looking for based on my experience with it.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.
11393	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00E5UP64Q	Radio Flyer Ride and Stand Stroll 'N Trike	VERY high quality, durable, glides super smooth and actually pleasant to push!	This trike is very impressive.  I love how it can be used from 9 months all the way up to around 6 years old.  It's also great to use for two children because one can hold on to the back.  But what's really great about it is the quality. This thing glides over the floor so smoothly and is very, very solid in construction.  There is a lot of thoughtfulness in the way it was made, too.  You don't have to stoop over to push it, the handle in the back makes it super easy to push (even my 5 year old can do it) and turn, etc...<br /><br />Basically this is a kid's fun version of a double stroller... it has the capability to be turned into a tricycle but if you put all the pieces together at once it fits two children and the front one has shade and can pedal while you push.<br /><br />SUPER worth the money, after putting it together I would expect something like this to cost near to 200 dollars.  It should be a classic, because I honestly think it will last through a couple of generations. Highly recommend!
11394	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00BG8F0NC	Monopoly Empire Game	The Empire is Back	If the classic game of Monopoly seemed to take too long, then you will appreciate this newer, shorter version. Instead of B&O Railroad, it is updated with businesses and brands like Spotify, ebay, Intel, Xbox, McDonalds and Coke. Instead of zipping around the board with an iron or a dog, you have a choice of a gold token like a coke bottle, game control, French fries, and motorcycle among others.<br /><br />You choose your token, roll the dice and start buying brands, add brands to your tower, and buy and trade and take over brands with empire cards.  First to the top of the tower wins. The game board reminds me of Times Square in appearance a bit.<br /><br />Contents include: 4 towers for up to four players, 6 tokens, 30 billboard tiles, 6 office tiles, 14 chance cards, 14 empire cards, money pack, 2 dice and the game guide.  I like this shorter, express version.  I used to call the classic version Monotony, partially because my brother always beat me at it because I virtuously would save all of my $$$ and he would spend his buying up all of the real estate in the first half of the game.  In the second half, I would just go around the board and pay him rent for hours on end until I ran out of $$$.  Not a good strategy on my part.<br /><br />I think this new version will be a hit for families who want a quick, fun game for family game night.  It has current, relevant brands which is fun.  And not all of the brands are about material consumption: there's ebay which is great for selling and recycling, and spotify which is about listening to good music for free - although they may charge a nominal price down the road.<br /><br />While it involves luck more than strategy, some of my favorite games as a child involved luck: Chutes and Ladders, Candyland, Parcheesi etc.  This is just a fun, light game for families to enjoy.  When my son comes home for the weekend - he was a board game designer and now video game designer - will get his opinion and let you know what he thinks.

11397	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B0008KLVA0	Prime Cut (1972)	Kind of proto-Tarantino half serious crime movie about Irish mobsters saving damsels in distress from an evil redneck crime lord	I rather liked this weird, shocking and less than half-serious 1972 crime film, even if it is not exactly a masterpiece. Below, more of my impressions, with some SPOILERS.    Irish mob bosses from Chicago have a problem - one of their business partners, known as Mary Ann (Gene Hackman) owes them money - in fact A LOT of money - and not only he obstinately refuses to pay, but treats most unkindly all those who are send to collect. Mary Ann lives on a farm near Kansas City and officially makes his money in cattle slaughtering and meat packaging, but in fact he is a dangeorus and vicious crime lord, ruling his rural neighborhood almost as a feodal duke.    Having received loud and clear (by mail) Mary Ann's latest unequivocal (and, in a way, very tasty) refusal to pay, Chicago mob bosses decide to send in another crew of debt collectors - this time more numerous and especially headed by a particularly vicious enforcer, Nick Devlin (Lee Marvin). Other than 50.000 dollars fee Devlin is also incited to take this offer by the oportunity of revenge - indeed, between him and Mary Ann there is considerable beef (sorry, I couldn't resist)... And then the film really begins.    This film mixes elements of:    - gangster movie, as there is lots of gangsters    - film noir, as there is a femme not only fatale but "tres fatale"    - western, as there are gunfights and chases in a very rural environment, and also lots of chattel (both four and two legged), shotguns and hats,    - parody, as the two bad guys, both muy macho, are called Mary Ann and Weenie...)))    - soft porn, as for most of the film young Sissy Spacek, for whom it was the first role ever, (and who is cute like a button and absolutely delicious as a damsel in distress) runs completely naked, full frontal included... We also learn a lot about intimate life of little orphan girls who never saw a man...    - promotion of vegetarianism becasue CLASSIFIED TO AVOID SPOILERS - but believe me, you will probably not want a steak or a sausage for some time after watching "Prime Cut"    - child movie (SPOILER WARNING HERE), as at one moment murderous gangsters with machine guns will mount on the white horse (OK, in fact get in a black car - but metaphorically speaking it is true) to save a virgin princess kept in a tower and later a lot of poor orphans from a bad, bad, bad lady...    As we can see, the coctail is indeed exotic and sometimes surrealistic - in fact it reminds me a little bit of Quentin Tarantino scenarios...    This film contains some deliberately very shocking scenes, including a slave auction - it certainly made a splash in 1972 - all rhytmed by a very good musical score by Lalo Shiffrin. Action scenes however aged a lot and are rather boring and the great finale showdown is very, very disappointing. Dialogs are a mixture of good one liners and smart come backs, but also sadly some banalities. Finally, actions of the bad guys finally don't make much sense and for that reason the frontal shock between Lee Marvin and Gene Hackman doesn't deliver as much as it could be expected.    But still it is an interesting film, with two excellent actors, a cute (and naked) damsel in distress, some shocking moments, some good dialogs, a femme (tres) fatale and, let's say it again, a lot of beef... ENJOY!

11399	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B00IJHHPQ8	Moen Moen GA821 Moen rinse basket, Stainless	This has two uses for me - a high quality rinse basket and a counter-top dish drainer with my dish drying mats underneath	I never use my dishwasher because I prefer to hand wash my dishes.  Since my sink is pretty big, this has been working perfectly during the rare times when I want to use a rinse basket to drain the dishes before I dry them.  It has also been working very well as a counter-top dish drying rack as long as I put a drying mat underneath (since it does not come with a drain board).  I never liked dish drainers so I use a drying mat similar to [[ASIN:B004M0P34M The OriginalTM Dish Drying Mat XL Microfiber Absorbent Machine Washable Fast Drying 18"X24" Multipurpose Extra Large]].  However, sometimes I wash so many dishes that they don't fit on the mat. With this rack, I can get 8 large fiesta dinner dishes and a couple of small bowls upright so that I don't have to wash the dishes in shifts.  I also sometimes wash the dishes and put them in the rinse basket and let them drain before putting the entire contraption with dishes on the drying mat.<br /><br />This rinse basket arrived in a box with no instructions to say what material it was made of, the measurements of the basket, or where to return for a replacement should the rack fail. The Amazon page says it's a stainless finish and has a 1-year warranty. The measurements on the Amazon page say it fits a bowl size that is 14 x 16  with center drain.  I would say that is correct since the rack measures 15 inches wide from front to back (long wise), 12 inches wide from side to side (width wise) at the widest point, and 6-1/2 inches high if I count the feet.  The feet are rubberized so that it does not slip around in the sink.<br /><br />My sink is 8 inches deep, 21-1/2 inches wide from left to right, and 17 inches wide from front to back (18-1/2 wide if I count the notch on the left).  I use this on the right side of my (single-bowl) sink and wash on the left side. I then store this in the top rack of my dishwasher within easy reach for when I want to use it again.  I could leave it in the sink but I do not always wash so many dishes at once. However, if I had side-by-side sinks, I would leave this in the sink.<br /><br />The unit feels very sturdy, is really nice looking, and what I consider a 5-star product.  The only reason I rated this 4 stars is because of the following:<br /><br />- Utensils fall through the rack as there is no utensil basket.  I could use my dishwasher utensil basket but that would take up valuable space in this rack.<br /><br />- I consider the current price of $63.75 a bit steep for a rinse basket.  However, if this lasts for life then it's cheap. Only time will tell if this lasts and does not rust; I will update my review if I encounter any problems.<br /><br />- The lack of an information sheet with the product description and warranty information is mildly disappointing.<br /><br />Other than this, I feel this basket is high quality and perfect as a rinse basket.  It is even more useful for me because I also use it as a counter-top dish drainer.
11400	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B00B1RB8FC	Last Exile: Fam, The Silver Wing, Season 2, Part 2 [Blu-ray]	An Entertaining Finale And Enjoyable Sequel	While the new cast for this sequel are as endearing as the previous LE the overall storyplot and villains and hero's also feels just the same as well. That's not to say the series is boring far from it you do wish though that they made the personalities of the character protagonist a little more original though with most animes and some shows that's pretty hard to do nowadays. I give kudos to keeping the animation the same as the previous LE and soundtrack score also fits nicely with the series,also you do get a special treat if you saw the first LE series as we see the return and cameos of characters from that series which is appreciated. The voice cast for both the Japanese subbed and English dubbed did a great job though with some of the previous LE characters they will of course sound somewhat different in the dub audio as the original voice actors and actress couldn't or wouldn't come back to dub their character voices though the people picked to dub those characters did a stellar job.<br /><br />So if you already have the first Last Exile series then this is a must have to add on to your anime collection or if you're just looking for a good anime series in general....

So when my sink started gurgling and slurping and making strange noises, especially when I flushed the toilet, I started looking things up online. It turned out that I installed the sink without adequate air venting. Doh! Well, a few minutes with the PVC saw and that amazing, sniffy solvent and the problem was solved. I'm pretty much sold of AAVs like this one for venting in tight spaces.    This Oatey AAV is great because it works, but also because it'll take two sized of PVC pipe -- just flip around the adapter. I went with the 2" for better flow.     UPDATE: Since first publishing this review, I've now installed three more of these on various sinks. I now swear by these AAV units. Do the PVC pipe work well and you're gonna love these.

11407	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B004NBVQ28	Select Step 5-Feet to 8-Feet 300-Pound Duty Rating Adjustable Step ladder	Lots to Love	There are a lot of things to love about this Little Giant Ladder:<br />+ The height of the front legs can be adjusted independently from the height of the back legs so that it can be placed on stairs.<br />+ The top standing platform is large, to provide full support to both feet.<br />+ The apex has a deep tray for holding small tools.<br />+ It comes with an Airdeck to attach above the apex that can be used as both a platform for supplies and a handrail (removable when not in use).<br />+ Included with the Airdeck are bungee cords for hanging tools off the platform.<br />+ It comes with wheels, so I can drag it around. (No, the wheels don't make contact with the ground when the ladder is open.)<br />+ The ladder is easy to open and close.<br />+ Feels solid on the ground, no worries about tipping.<br /><br />Some information that should be but never is provided with the specs for ladders: at its maximum height, the top standing platform is 67 1/2&#34; from the ground. Folded, the ladder is 5' tall and 27&#34; wide at the base.<br /><br />The Airdeck could use some improvement. It's supposed to provide more stability for us when standing on the top platform, but the wobble makes me feel a little nervous. My husband double checked to make sure it was installed correctly. He lost his balance on the way down and grabbed it for support. It held tight, worked like it's supposed to, but we'd both like it better if it felt more solid.<br /><br />Still, I do like this ladder. We use it to change the light bulbs in our chandeliers, which was always a difficult task before. My husband used to lean an old ladder against the wall and have me stand below to hold it. Now, he can do it all by himself.

11412	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00KM9PJ50	I HEART KEENWAH QUINOA CLSTR GNGR PNUT, 4 OZ	it's hard to eat just one serving of these!	I got a 4 ounce bag of these through a subscription box service and it was a challenge not to eat the whole bag in one sitting (each serving is one ounce).<br /><br />First, since there's currently not much product information on the page (including no &#34;Nutrition Facts&#34; box):<br /><br />Ingredients: Organic Quinoa (Whole Grain Quinoa, Quinoa Flakes, Quinoa Crisps), Peanuts, Tapioca Syrup, Raw Sugar, Crystallized Ginger (Ginger, Cane Sugar), Honey, Brown Rice Crisps, Almond Oil, Baking Soda, Salt<br /><br />These are gluten free (certified) but obviously not vegan (honey). This is stating the obvious, of course, but they contain peanut and tree nut (almond oil) ingredients.<br /><br />As I mentioned before, one serving is an ounce, which contains 120 calories (35 from fat). One serving has 0.5 grams of saturated fat but no cholesterol. One serving has 35 mg of sodium and 20 g of carbohydrates (very little fiber and about 10g of sugar). Finally, these have 3g of protein per serving and a tiny amount (about 2%) of iron. If I haven't mentioned something else that is commonly included on the nutrition part of the label, that's because it isn't in this product (i.e., no vitamin C).<br /><br />Texture-wise, these are very similar to the hard/crunchy kind of granola bars. These are broken into pieces maybe 1/2 inch square (not quite 1/2 inch thick). You do see big, whole peanut halves in these. I mostly notice the peanut flavor; the quinoa doesn't add much flavor and the ginger is more of a mild undertone (it's there, but not overpowering).<br /><br />Maybe it's because I haven't let myself eat too many snack foods lately or maybe not, but I think these things are delicious. I'd definitely consider buying these in the future (as well as looking for other flavors from the same company).

You can use it in the garage you can use it in the home.  I use it to transfer large batches of food into storage containers without spilling all over the place.<br /><br />It's pretty large but guess what?  It fits in my dishwasher and it seems to be dishwasher safe.  It didn't melt anyway.<br /><br />Large enough to wear as a hat if you wanted to.  Just sayin'.

The oil was shipped with adequate padding to prevent breakage of the glass bottle and came with a 59-page product guide from the company that describes each oil's properties and uses along with tips for use and descriptions of assorted blends. It also came with an insert titled &#34;101 Ways to Use Essential Oils&#34; that includes how to use essential oils for home, aroma, health, beauty, kids, emotions, spiritual needs, and travel. I am just beginning to learn about essential oils so I appreciate having both guides. I'm very pleased with this product!
11420	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B00O0292FI	Magic in the Moonlight [Blu-ray]	(BLU RAY REVIEW) 3 1/2 stars.  More moonlight than magic	In Woody Allen's 2014 annual European set film, he goes back in time to the Roaring `20's.  Colin Firth plays Stanley Crawford who is a famous magician who goes by the name and disguise of Wei Ling Soo.  Stanley is approached by his good friend and fellow magician, Howard Burkan (Simon McBurney) to go to England and help him expose a supposed medium who he believes is hoodwinking the wealthy Catledge family into investing a fortune into an organization that promotes supernatural contact with the deceased.<br /><br />Stanley agrees, but like Howard, has a hard time finding the secrets.  In fact, he becomes convinced that the young American, Sophie (Emma Stone) is the real deal after she advances secrets about himself.  Marcia Gay Harden plays Sophie's mother, but really doesn't have much to do.  Jacki Weaver plays Grace Catledge, the widow who is trying to contact her late husband.  Hamish Linklater plays Brice Catledge, the playboy son who is smitten with Sophie and courts her with song and ukulele.<br /><br />This is lightweight stuff to be sure, but Allen offers a fine script and compelling characters to make it enjoyable.  Some of the best scenes are with Stanley and his Aunt Vanessa (Eileen Atkins) who lives near the Catledge's.  In one particular scene, Stanley argues with himself as to whether he should pursue Sophie.  Vanessa provides one liners that bounce back Stanley's own arguments.  It's funny and sweet.  Granted, we know all is not what it seems but I won't spoil the Agatha Christie-like reveal.  To be sure, this isn't one of Allen's masterpieces or even one of his best.  But I enjoyed it and recommend it, especially to Allen's fans.<br /><br />The Blu ray transfer comes in a 1080p video resolution with a 2.40:1 aspect ratio.  The technicians do a serviceable job transferring the film to the digital format.  The filmmakers chose a light hazy, sepia tone to the picture and it is nicely replicated here.  Close-ups are particularly good with fine detail and excellent skin tones consistent with the overall limitations.  Black levels are generally good.  Light grain can be seen throughout.  I was a little surprised to see a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track with this movie.  I seem to remember Allen almost always goes with stereo.  In any case the audio is very good, although the surrounds are mostly in play with the musical score and an early scene when Sophie and Stanley get caught in a thunderstorm.  The dialog centric movie is very clear with most of the audio coming from the center speaker.  The package includes subtitles in English SDH, Spanish and French.  Extras include a piece called "Behind the Magic" and another "On the Red Carpet" as well as a trailer.

I went to several bog box stores and found the same unit for around $30. I returned home and ordered this one at more than 25% less than the ones in the stores. however I did take the white hose instead of the green and that was not my best decision as the white color really stand out along side the foundation. This hose is actually for the transportation of drinking water and is actually an overkill for my purposes. The fittings are excellent and it absolutely does not kink.

So I suspect it is both the amount of grounds the cup holds as well as the Ekobrew being able to extract more flavor due to  how water passes through the grounds.<br /><br />I also like the Ekobrew better because it is 100% reusable.  This Melitta system while initially a lot less money does use disposable filters which add to extra cost.<br /><br />While the Ekobrew costs a bit upfront it is worth it.  I have an Ekobrew for over a year and have had no problem with it (note I have about a 12 and use 2-3 every day).  Even with heavy daily use they all still have held up well.

When you use this continuously the can becomes freezing cold, so you should probably where gloves if you use it in the Winter.

11431	__label2__	5	Y	Watches	B004FPMOVY	Nemesis Men's SSN910K Punk Rock Collection Black Snake Skull Watch with Leather Band	Very Happy with the Quality and the Look - Great Deal	I purchased this for my ex-husband for Father's Day as a gift from our three children. He has always loved dragon designs and he has been needing a watch. The design was definitely something he would like so even though I was not at all familiar with the brand, I went ahead and purchased the watch hoping the quality would be acceptable. The watch arrived yesterday and I was very happy with the purchase. The watch has a quality, heavy feel to it but not so heavy that wearing it would be uncomfortable. The band isn't so wide that it looks immature, making it suitable for a grown man. In fact, the band was thinner than I thought it would be and gives a fashionable, refined look to it. I have to say it is a very nice looking watch. It is also unique, which is a plus. A great watch for someone who does not like to wear the same old same old when it comes to accessories. I will definitely look into other designs by this brand for future gift purchases.

Very well made knife with great fit & finish .  Ergonomics are decent - not the best, but certainly not the worst, and for the price it's certainly nothing to complain about!  The blade is extremely robust and made from Japanese AUS8a stainless steel.  The knife however is made in Taiwan, but in my personal experience, I've found that blades made in Taiwan sport the same quality as USA made products.<br /><br />The only negative I can say about this knife is that it's on the heavy side for an EDC folder.  But otherwise, it's a great hard use folder for outdoors and self defense.  Amazing blade for $20  Recommended!

(Link here: [[ASIN:B004TJ6JH6 NEEWER® 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel Digital Camera / Camcorder Video Light, LED Light for Canon, Nikon, Pentax, Panasonic,SONY, Samsung and Olympus Digital SLR Cameras]])  They're essentially the same price, but this one from Selens is much brighter and has more features.<br /><br />Pros:<br />✅ Stunningly bright.<br />✅ Solid, quality feel.  Not like the Neewer light, which felt pretty cheap and plasticy.<br />✅ Easy to adjust brightness using dial. (see my video)<br />✅ Gels (filters) are very useful. Cuts the glare.<br />✅ Versatile: You can use lots of different kinds of batteries.  I personally use my Canon 70D batteries, since I have a lot of those already.  You can also use 6X AA batteries (not included).<br />✅ Hot shoe mount fits my Canon 70D beautifully.<br />✅ As far as I can tell, there's no high-pitched whine like I hear on other LED lights.<br />✅ Very nice people at Selens. They actually sent me this light to test and video review.<br /><br />Cons:<br />🍅 Does not get hot.  My bacon stayed limp and never crisped whilst laying upon it.  Though it still smelled like Christmas.<br /><br />Summary: 5/5 stars. The best bang for your buck when it comes to a portable lighting system for your filming.

11438	__label2__	4	N	Home	B006FJW5YY	Zenna Home, India Ink Galahad 3-Piece Bath Set, Antique Pewter	Rugged and Stylish	This bath set is pretty standard, with a tooth brush holder, liquid soap/lotion dispenser, and bar soap holder.  I find the combination of two soap holders redundant and would have preferred an extra holder for things like toothpaste.  The design is great, with a classical shape and pattern that would fit most bathrooms.<br /><br />The material is not metal, but it is thankfully not ceramic either.  Instead, it uses the rugged plastic resin that is common with new sets.  The paint color works well with chrome or nickel fixtures.  Because it is plastic, there is no need for maintenance to avoid rust.  Unfortunately, the pump mechanism is made of a cheap-looking plastic.  I can understand the main components being resin, but using a standard metal pump would have added some class and durability.<br /><br />Overall, I am very happy with this bath set.  Apart from the pump, it adds to the look and functionality of my bathroom.
11439	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00BQYQYHC	Fisher-Price Roll N Go Get Away Garage	Best gift this year for our almost 3yo (he's able to use it all by himself too!)	This was a christmas gift for our almost 3yo son from his aunt - He LOVED it - all present opening stopped for about 30 minutes since he simply could not wait for us to get this out of the box so he could play with it - we had to let him play with ½ of it b/c he was so excited!!  It was hands down the best gift this year.  It did take his dad a few minutes to assemble (like 10 minutes maybe) - but once put together it's worked almost flawlessly - my son LOVES using the elevator (& closing the gate every time) - then taking the car over with the crane - & he was able to use all of this entirely on his own after the first time we showed him.<br /><br />The only thing about this that could be designed a bit better would be the police car ramp (at the top of the elevator there's a ramp that holds a car - it's designed so when the car in the elevator is released onto the top level that ramp releases the car it's holding - so you end up with the police car chasing the yellow car).  It's a bit of a pain to load - I have to use both hands to keep the release in place (since otherwise the ramp doesn't stay up) - or I have to hold it up while my son puts it in.  This is the only bit he struggle to do on his own (he gets lucky every once in a while though).<br /><br />The pull out extension of the road on the bottom level is kinda weird - not sure why it's even necessary & can be a bit uncooperative at times when it comes to getting it back in - but it's not like that has any effect on the overall functionality of this product.  I will admit - I am concerned about how long the crane will last - the spring is quite strong - so when my son pulls it over to the other level it snaps back quite quickly.  Not concerned about it hurting my son - but am concerned that it will eventually crack the molded plastic or something....we'll see.<br /><br />But overall we're totally thrilled with this toy - as is my son.  Even we've had fun playing with this thing...it's great.  I imagine there may be some people who get some duds - whenever you involve mass production of molded plastic & a lot of little moving parts, that happens - but fisher price has always been pretty good at providing replacements for us when this has happened (can't speak to this specific product - but if you have trouble with yours I suggest just contacting fisher price - they'll probably send you a new one).  Definitely recommend this for any toddler who loves cars.

11443	__label2__	4	N	Home Improvement	B00F19KW0S	Lux Products TX500U Universal 5-2 Programmable Thermostat	Great for the price	I live in a rental unit - but that doesn't stop me from swapping out their terrible fixtures with some of my own!  I've swapped out light switches with dimmers, crummy low-flow shower heads with nice big ones that have much better water pressure, etc.  I plan on taking it all with me when I leave - it's easy to swap out stuff like that.  Hence my desire to replace that god-awful 1980s thermostat with something like this - a digital, programmable modern-day thermostat.<br />I swapped out thermostats before.  They're about as simple as it gets.  At least for old homes - there's only two wires to worry about.  Kill the power to the unit (use a power or line tester if you have one - they're cheap and come in handy) and stick the wires in the correct holes.<br />The instructions were a little wordy / confusing.  It includes one giant sheet that shows all these different possible configurations of wiring your home may have.  If you've never done this before, it may be a little daunting.  But I managed to figure it out without destroying my apartment, so you probably will too!<br />This unit has some neat functions to it, but they're not exactly intuitive.  Me, I don't need them;  I live alone (for now) so I just set it to the temperature I want when I walk in the door.  I turn everything off when I leave.  I told a friend recently that I do this, and they told me it may actually be cheaper to leave it on all day, rather than have the system fight to bring the temperature down at the end of the day.  So, with that said, I'll take a deeper dive into the programming features.  I like things to be simple - dead-easy to figure out and use.  This device is a little on the complex side, being that you have to hit several selections just to choose one option.  BUT - for me?  For the price?  I like it.  It's cheap - and it's modern - and it shows the temerature of my apartment versus the temperature I want it to be.  Living alone, I don't need much more.  I was hesistant to use this thermostat being that I'd never heard of &#34;Lux Products&#34; before - but I'm pleased with it.
11444	__label2__	4	N	Toys	B00KNT6QG0	LeapFrog Learning Game Letter Factory Adventures: The Rainforest (for LeapPad tablets and LeapsterGS)	A lecture/quiz disguised as a platform video game.	There have been many attempts to create educational &#34;games&#34; over the years. During the early days of home computing, most kids saw right through this (though I admit to quite enjoying Where in the World is Carmen San Diego before realizing it was teaching me stuff). Beyond those early days, I have very little exposure to learning games, but like many parents, I feel better with my child running &#34;educational&#34; software rather than midless space shooters. With that in mind, here are my impressions of this LeapFrog title...<br /><br />Last year, I got my then-3 year old son a LeapPad 2, and earlier this year I got to upgrade him to a LeapPad 3 so we could review it for Amazon. Since then, he has accumulated a small variety of cartridges for it, and he spends time on his &#34;green iPad.&#34; He still prefers to watch YouTube toy review videos on his mom's real iPad, though.<br /><br />For his 4th birthday, he received a new Thomas the Tank Engine playset and this Rainforest cartridge. He was thrilled at the new Thomas set, but I managed to get him to spend a bit of time with the LeapPad. The game spends some time with cute animations an narrations explaining what it is about. He was not in the mindset to focus on all the talking and was trying to skip through them. Once the actual game began, it appeared to be a platform-style game. My son has not become video game obsessed yet (he still prefers real world play), so I helped him a bit with basic controls. The character walked through the rainforest until it touches an animal. Then, icons come up and dialog plays describing attributes of different types of animals. It then asks the player to choose what type of animal they just found. It followed up with a similar thing about types of feed (webbed, bird claws, etc.) and asks about that. At least in the first stage, it appeared to be a simple &#34;I'll tell you something, then ask you a question&#34; quiz program, disguised as a platform game.<br /><br />Ithought it was neat (though as a child, I would have found it a very un-fun video game, but certainly a more entertaining educational title). My son, however, soon went back to moving toy trains around his new multi-level playset. I expect he will revisit this title in coming months/years (it has a good age range), but it is clear that right now, video games won't pull him away from the Island of Sodor.<br /><br />I don't find anything particular bad about this title, and it seems an entertaining way to learn about animals and such. I suppose if you child is more in to rainforest stuff than trains, they would find this far more interesting.

11446	__label2__	5	N	Watches	B0055QIN62	Invicta Men's 1254 Sea Spider Stainless Steel Mechanical Skeleton Watch with Black Band	Huge!  .. Very Striking	This watch is an eye catcher.  It's big and beefy and heavy... you know you are wearing a timepiece.  Everyone who noticed my new watch was asking about it and it really sets off a casual outfit.  Pros: Cool composite band - very trendy, but cool black. Skeleton see-through is very detailed and jeweled Waterproof, so no worries in common usage around water.  Cons: Big -- not for tiny man arms. Must wind....  Perhaps I've gotten too used to self winding Clasp can be difficult to open, but it never accidentally pops.  Update 6/2015 -- I've had this watch for a long time now and it still keeps time and looks like it did on day one.  It's striking -- I get a lot of comments on this watch, much more than any other watch I own.   It really has a great look and complements casual and business casual well. I've had to maintain the band's screws to keep them tight, recently using a threadlock gel to ensure they stay in without risk.  The bezel has zero marks on it and the glass is unscratched.    That's saying a lot -- with its size, it has taken a few impacts catching edges or doorframes.   The Skeleton nature of the face is intricate with its gems and must be what draws people to the face... either way, I don't have its equal on my nightstand and it brings me to looking at some of the Invicta Reserves as a future investment.   I'm very satisfied with this watch.

I've changed from 5 stars to 3.<br /><br />Pros: I like almost everything about this. The musical accompaniment is sweet, helps with practice to keep in time and key. So many presets, likely several will be good for anyone's individual tastes.<br /><br />Cons: It's not a guitar, so think of it as the unique device that it is, and you'll be happy with it. The muting bar at the base of the strings doesn't always work, although I'm sure this can be tweaked.<br />Batteries: about 5 hours of playing time for each 4 AA battery set. Seems a bit expensive. They could have made it use much less juice by auto-light dimming. Engineers can't foresee everything...<br /><br />Construction: I think 10:1 this is built in China. Oh... where to begin. The first one I had was with major issues. The CPU somehow was not operating, or the control board, and the device would reset during play, or not stay on one preset. Amazon was good enough to send me another one. Alas, this one has issues too. The whammy bar is a bit wobbly, and it can easily be activated even when it is not desired. I know this because the last one had a whammy bar you could set perpendicular to the device, and it would not activate at all. I'm debating whether to take it off permanently, or just return the device and forget about it. That said, I love the idea behind this device, it is an ideal. Although their manufacturing process seems to have quality issues. You might get one that has no issues. If you do, I'm happy for you.
11452	__label2__	4	N	Video DVD	B002KLQ2Y0	Franklyn [Blu-ray]	"If you believe in something strongly enough, who's to say if it's real or not?"	Revolving around four lost souls and set in two parallel worlds, Franklyn certainly isn't the Dark City/superhero movie it was rather misleadingly sold as but a rather more ambitious variation on that old arthouse favourite, the apparent strangers who are gradually drawn to the same place and event that will impact differently on each of their lives. There's probably no more to it than meets the eye, but Gerald McMorrow moves and shoots his pieces so well that it's surprisingly satisfying to see them come together. If anything, despite its impressively designed if sparingly used fantasy scenes, the film is probably more influenced by Wim Wenders' Wings of Desire with its hints of people, possibly real, possibly not, who come into your life at the right time and then fade away.<br /><br />Eva Green is a troubled performance artist whose art project is built around filming her meticulously planned suicide attempts; Bernard Hill a church warden searching London for his missing son; Sam Riley an incurable romantic just jilted at the altar yet again and searching for his childhood sweetheart; and Ryan Philippe a masked atheist in a city of religious fanatics seeking revenge on the cult leader who killed a girl he was hired to protect. Gradually stories and actors (though not their roles) start to overlap, fantasies punctured and old wounds reopened or cauterised. Think about it too much and you'll probably be way ahead of the filmmakers, but go with the film at its own pace and it's surprisingly rewarding. McMurrow has a real visual sense that too few British filmmakers have: it's not just empty style or good looking shots for the sake of being good looking but in service of the story, characters and ideas. Those ideas may not be particularly deep or profound - ultimately little more than the need to acknowledge reality, however painful, rather than hiding in fantasy before you can move on - but they're delivered with sincerity and imagination and, with the partial exception of Riley's rather typically milquetoast turn, convincingly played.<br /><br />It'd be stretching it to say that Franklyn is a great film, but it is a great and encouraging directorial debut. It'll be interesting to see what McMorrow comes up with next.<br /><br />The Blu Ray has a decent selection of extras for a film that made so little impression at the box-office, including making of featurette and deleted scenes but not, sadly, McMorrow's 2002 short Thespian X which inspired the film.

As for the colors, yes, they are a little more pink and somewhat purple than the picture shows, but still very nice. I am baffled as to why they aren't shipped with any padding in between the coasters (they are just in a box). A couple of them have small chips, but not enough to go through the hassle of sending them back.

11458	__label2__	4	N	Home Entertainment	B004TPJKEY	Sharp HT-SB600 Audio Sound Bar System (Black)	Good for the money	This is a nice sound bar for the money.  It is very easy to set up, and has 3 HDMI inputs for your added convenience.  It comes in an attractive glossy black finish.  The sound quality is very nice, and the bass is incredible.  However, I have trouble hearing dialog when watching movies unless I turn the volume very high.  When you are using this on low volume, you can only hear the sound effects, and it is very difficult to hear the dialog.  I tried many different settings, but still have same problems.  However, when I blast it, it sounds great.  Very movie like quality.  It works especially great when I am playing games on the PS3.  I get so much bass and it sounds incredible.    If you have a smaller room, this sound bar will fill your room nicely.  It doesn't really replicate surround sound very well, but good enough to get a better movie experience.  You do have a lot of wires when connecting this.  There are about 6 speaker wires and then you have the HDMI in and out and power cord.  I guess we are just so spoiled with this day and age of wireless.    It does not come with any HDMI cables, so make sure you buy some before you install this.  All in all, for the money, it is worth it.

Quite simply the quality was terrible. I stream other video content on my TV but when talking to my brother in Japan, the video quality was just terrible. I realize this is more a function of the TV, not the camera, but since there's so few models it works with, and I am not about to go out and buy another TV to try it with, this is a big consideration.<br /><br />I also didn't like the wide screen view it uses at all. Great I guess if you have a big family, but my couch is at a distance that I end up being barely visible to the caller. I didn't see an easy way to zoom in or adjust the angle when I am sitting on the floor for instance.<br /><br />Overall, it just didn't give me any benefits over using Skype on my iMac or iPad or iPhone, etc. Really the only reason I guess you would get this is if you routinely want to make calls with a large number of people on one camera.

This one is solid. While I can't claim I've used it enough to see if it stands the test of time, the cork comes out much easier, and the whole unit is built very solidly. It also fits snugly on the top of the wine bottle, and the screw is long enough that it pulls the cork out the whole way the first time so I don't have to apply any lateral pressure. If you want a winged corkscrew, this is the way to go.

11466	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B000JBXHZ0	Villisca: Living with a Mystery	A Compelling Documentary About America's Worst Ax-Murder	This is not a sensational account of the ax-murder of eight innocent people in the town of Villisca, Iowa, in 1912. If you are looking for lurid graphics, you'll have to look elsewhere. This is more the story of a typical, turn-of-the-century rural town.<br /><br />Villisca was a Thornton Wilder "Our Town" of a place, but one whose gentle clickety-clack through time got derailed by a bizarre murder. The town's railroad and its comfortingly scheduled passings indeed set the tone for this sober account. However, the train might also have been instrumental in delivering a killer to the Moores' doorstep one dark night.<br /><br />It's strange how some murders, like the Lizzie Borden ax-murders, remain in our collective memory and even become part of our vernacular, our common pool of referenced happenings. Meanwhile, other much more shocking and mysterious murders, such as this one, are forgotten by everyone except local people. Some of the film's commentators speculate on such disparities in sustained interest. This documentary brings the tragedy of Villisca out of the shadows, but in the context of the town's larger life.<br /><br />A number of Villisca locals, children at the time of the murders, appear in this documentary, filmed through the 1990's and early 2000's. These elders give first-hand accounts of the days preceding the murders - and the whirlwind of days that followed it. They talk about the heightened suspicion and prejudice that infected the town, reinforcing laws against members of minority groups being allowed to stay there overnight. They talk about the sequence of people who were suspected of the crime.<br /><br />The killings had some distinctive ritualistic, sexual aspects. So the town's primary suspicions might seem ludicrously misguided to us today. We've been well-informed by CSI shows about the likely psychological profile of such a killer - and that profile hardly fit the man upon whom the town settled their conviction of guilt for a while. It's also hard to understand why a series of similar killings in other towns eventually came to be deemed irrelevant to the Villisca case. However, the elders who appear here tell about the business rivalries and the illicit romances that were tacit common knowledge in 1912 Villisca - and which then got hung out on the clothes lines as what seemed like obvious motives for murder after the fact.<br /><br />These first-hand accounts and the accounts of researchers are generously interspersed with sepia photographs of that 1912 time and place. "Villisca" becomes reminiscent of a Ken Burns documentary.<br /><br />There are a lot of good extras on this DVD.  These include two excellent commentaries. The commentary by local researcher-historian Edgar Epperly provides an especially literate, evocative accompaniment to a crime that is at once so far-removed from us, and yet so affecting. This is an intelligent, absorbing film on all levels.

I was visiting there with family over the Christmas vacation. They were $0.99 a for a single serving bag and I thought they look cool so I picked up one. They weren't bad, but they weren't what they claim either.<br /><br />They didn't taste like &#34;Birthday Cake.&#34; When I think of birthday cake I think of a chocolate or vanilla cake with thick whipped frosting and sugar sprinkles. I expect a vanilla and cream or chocolate and cream taste. However, all I got was the chocolate. They did taste like chocolate cake, I will give them that, but not like a chocolate birthday cake. They are larger than other MMs, and I'm not sure why. I really hope that MMs continues that flavor next year, but that they call it something more suitable like Chocolate Cake, Cake, or Brownie flavor instead.<br /><br />Positives<br /><br />-Larger Than  Normal<br />-Chocolate Cake Taste<br /><br />Negatives<br />-No Frosting Taste<br />-Go Stale Faster Than Others (learned the hard way)<br /><br />I would suggest that you only purchase these if you simply want a large or more chocolate MM not a birthday cake flavored one.

If an issue ever occurs I would return here to update the review and let you know what the issue was and how resolution was handled. We did receive this duffel bag gratis from the seller and our daughter put it to use to objectively find out how well it performed. My statements here reflect that testing.<br /><br />We found this duffel bag to be better than expected, nicely stylish, affordable and quite roomy. If you are looking for a lightweight bag for your on the go needs, for use as I have described above, then our daughter would recommend giving this bag from BAGO a try based on her experience with it.<br /><br />Very recommended.<br /><br />Go for it.

11489	__label2__	4	N	Books	1905239904	Doctor Who: Betrothal of Sontar	More Adventures with Rose and the Tenth Doctor	This book collects the Tenth Doctor's first comic book stories, with all but the last one having Rose as his companion. The strips originally appeared in Doctor Who Magazine Issues 365-380 and the the 2007 Doctor Who Story Book.<br /><br />The Betrothal of Sontar (365-367): The first 10th Doctor comic book story and the titular story from this collection finds the Doctor on an arctic world where a bunch of deviations in the Sontarans have a base far from the action of the war and under the command of a purebred Sontaran who ends ups using the Doctor to find a doomsday weapon. This is actually the weakest story in the book. It's a Sontaran story where no one acts like a Sontaran. The purebed Sontaran has a mustache and sits around alone with his chest plate off revealing a hairy chest and wears fur shoulder pads. Even with a generic alien, this would be an average story. For bungling the Sontarans, it's a notch below that. Grade: D+<br /><br />The Lodger (368): The Doctor is stuck on Earth and living with Mickey for a spell. The story is fun and does a nice job putting the Doctor into a unique situation. Roberts would later take the idea of the comic and make it a TV script for the 11th Doctor. You'll find the barebones of the idea here but other than the Doctor being good at soccer, little of the plot crosses over. Grade: A-<br /><br />F.A.Q. (369-371): This is a story that actually is reminiscent of &#34;Fear Her&#34; (a story that aired in the same series as the comic strips),  so it's weird the magazine ran this one.  The story is better than &#34;Fear Her&#34; but the similarities are striking. At any rate, the Doctor and Rose arrive in a block where weird things are happening and people are disappearing and strange things start happening including mysterious disappearance and three boys being turned into trees. It all seems to center on a boy and is sister. This story twists around like a pretzel, it's very clever and rich with a lot of emotion, psychology, andmisdirection at work. The commentary in the back reveals the real life modeling of the characters which makes the story even more enjoyable. Great concept and really good execution. Grade: A<br /><br />The Futurists (372-374): This is the type of story you see in comics, audio, and novels, but never on the TV series as we have a story based on an obscure fact of history, sprinkle in sci fi and enjoy. In this case, the Doctor and Rose land in Italy between the Wars where the Futurists are beginning a movement that would become Italian fascism. An alien transports one of these Futurists back in time and gives him the chance to conquer the world. This is a wonderfully researched story that has several great twists in the final parts. Mike Collins art is great throughout the book (excepting some of the Sontaran designs in the first story of course.) but this is his best work in the book. I love his drawings of 1920s Italy and the clothing for the era is superb too. There's also a few nice humor bits sprinkled throughout.I loved Rose showing the psychic paper to an illiterate soldier. Grade: A+<br /><br />Interstellar Overdrive (375-376): The TARDIS lands on a tour ship featuring a zombified singer leading a band of misfit has-beens. Of course, there's a murder mystery and a few nice end-jokes. The Time Loop that's a big plot device for the cliffhanger is a bit weak as the Doctor and Rose remember everything which serves to expedite the time loop solution but also isn't really how those things should work. Still, this is a fun story. Grade: B+<br /><br />Opera of Doom (2007 Doctor Who Story Book): This story finds the Doctor taking Rose to the opera where strange things are afoot and an alien eats music. This is a story that's too short but that's really the fault of the BBC which demanded a shorter length to protect its Doctor Who Annual and that hurt this tale. It could have done with a few more pages, but it's okay as is with a nice comic and some good lines. Grade:B<br /><br />The Green Eyed Monster (DWM 377): In Rose's final comic story, writer Nev Fountain decided to play with the idea promoted by many that Rose and her crew were kind of poor and trashy where Rose's adventures with the Doctor and one adventure in particular are fodder for a Jerry Springereseque Daytime talk show. This strip not only gets Mickey in, but also Jackie and in a quiet unusual way. Fountain manages to gently poke fun at some of Doctor Who's tropes as an alien princess tells the Doctor, &#34;Our scientists have been mystified as to why our planet is solely populated by stunningly attractive with physical ages of eighteen to twenty.&#34; The strip does a lot in 10 pages, playing with Rose's jealousy of other women around the Doctor, perceptions of the Tyler family, and even works a riff of Peter Davison's famous line from the Fury of the Deep. Nicely done. Grade: A<br /><br />The Warkeeper's Crown: The only visual teaming of the Brigadier and a revived series Doctor finds the Brigadier kidnapped from a Remembrance Day ceremony in full uniform. He arrives to find he's being asked to lead a war-like species into battle because he's the greatest military leader the Doctor knows. They also kidnap Mike Yates, however instead of the Brigadier's former UNIT aide, they kidnap a back bench member of parliament whose kind of petty. There are a few confusing points in the plot, but this is ultimately a love letter to the Brigadier and it works. It's a great dynamic between the post-time War Doctor and the Brigadier as the Brig realizes that the Doctor has been a war. Good stuff.  Also, a key moment from the Series 8 finale may have had its genesis in the last page of this comic. Grade: A-<br /><br />With the exception of the first story, I found most everything else in the book to be thoroughly enjoyable. There are some great concepts. Even though, many of these were planned with very little known of the 10th Doctor they captured the character well. Rose was usually pretty good, though she did occasionally become a bit of a comic foil. This is a very solid volume of comics from Doctor Who magazine that's a must read for fans of the 10th Doctor.

My two large goldfish (about 5 inches nose to tail) live in a 10 gallon tank with a waterfall filter.  We went on a two week trip and I was worried about how they would eat.  I'm glad I found these 14-day feeders.  When I got home, the blocks were gone, but the water was clear and the fish were healthy.  It worked exactly as promised.
11492	__label2__	5	N	Beauty	B00NGQYU24	Key Lime Salt Scrub 13oz	luxurious and effective	I love salt scrubs.  This one is a little pricy but the container is huge so it will last you a long time.  (You really don't need to use salt scrubs every day, anyway.)  I generally only use them on my upper arms, because that's where I'm least happy with my skin, although there's no reason you couldn't use this all over.    It has a lovely citrus (lime) scent.  It separates a little when stored but the container does mention that you should mix it up before using.  Shaking will not be effective -- you'll want something stiff like a knife to stir it, because it's pretty thick. Or just take the shortcut I've been using and try to get a little of the oil and a little of the solid part and mix it in your palm.    I can really feel this working.  One thing to watch out for -- this may sting a bit if you use it right after shaving.  I use it typically at the end of a shower, after shaving under my arms, and if a little salt migrates down there, it can hurt.  So just be careful where/when you apply it.  (It's not bad, but it was somewhat surprising the first time I experienced the sensation, so I thought I would mention it.)    The salt dissolves as you rub this around.  When you rinse it off, there's a bit of residue left over, but this absorbs pretty well into the skin within a few minutes of getting out of the shower.  And it's very moisturizing, even if you don't follow with a lotion.    In the end, I definitely think the appearance of the skin on my upper arms has improved since I started using this.  Plus, I love the smell.  I'm torn as to whether to buy a different scent (so I can try them all) or get the same one again, when I run out.
11493	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B00A926MUQ	Oscar Schmidt OE30 Delta Blues Semi Hollow Electric Guitar, BlueBurst, OE30FBLB	VERY good.	This is a guitar I've had for, oh, at least 12 years now.  And it's held up.<br /><br />It's first important for me to mention that this is a very good guitar ***at this price point***.  Indeed, parts of this guitar certainly exceeded my expectations, with the fit and finish of the wood being really quite good.  On mine, some hardware (switches, dials, etc) was wobbly in the fittings so I did need to take some time to address those points.  On the other hand, the tuners were nice right out of the box.  So go figure.<br /><br />It also bears mentioning, clearly, that this is a Chinese product.  Sure, it says &#34;crafted&#34; in China, but it's still not of this shore so if that bothers you, well, there you go.  I don't have a problem with it as this is not a keepsake instrument, but even that said this instrument has surprised me at times, making it easy for me to overlook the country of origin.  However,  like other Chinese &#34;crafts,&#34; sometimes you can see the choices they made that gets you to that attractive price point.  For instance, this has a rosewood fingerboard.  Rosewood in and of itself isn't bad, but I don't think it's the best choice on this style of guitar (my opinion, don't shoot me).  It's cheaper than the alternatives though, so that's probably why it's there.<br /><br />I've seen some consistency issues across the line as well.  For instance, the color of mine is more of a washed out blue, approaching a bluish lavender in fact.<br /><br />Tone on this is VERY surprising.  It sounds great!  Seriously, it's got this kind of timbre to it that I can't describe.  It reminds me of the kid that grew up poor but ended up going to high school in the rich part of town.  It's going to try harder and it brings something unique.  Ditch the factory strings and put some good 'uns on there, and I think you'll be happy with the result.<br /><br />For an informal instrument where you don't feel like spending the green for a name brand, this one works quite well.  Again, it's fun for me to just jam on without worrying about turning heads because of the name on headpiece.  I like this instrument.  A lot.
11494	__label2__	5	N	Beauty	B00KCMF5T2	LOUISE MAELYS 31" 80cm Long Curly Gold Yellow Anime Cosplay Hair With Ponytail Styling Wigs	Gorgeous and full, should fit most female adults & some males	This review is for the 31&#34; Long Curly Gold Yellow Wig<br /><br />Free product provided for evaluation and review.<br /><br />Wow, this wig is gorgeous.  It is a very nice sunny blond.  It should work for blond yellow cosplays.<br />It is nice and full, and the wig-cap inside it is tightly woven and lace at the crown, making it an easy wig to sew into if that treatment is needed for a costume. I also like that they made the interior a light beige and that really helps it look more natural. It does adjust inside.<br /><br />The hair is quite natural looking - my natural blond hair is in picture beside it - it compares very well to natural hair, it is just a bit shinier.<br />It’s easy to comb and work with.  The waves are loose and the cut is long layers, which give it some added volume.<br />It can be styled with setting lotion and a hairdryer on cool or no heat, or set and curled and left to dry.  It has retained it’s out of box waviness well for me.<br /><br />It should fit most adults.  It fits me perfectly and I am a cap size MEDIUM with a head diameter of 22.5.”  It would stretch a bit more if needed.  It does have straps so it will adjust down to about a 21”.  I think any smaller than that would need a smaller long wig.<br /><br />It can be pinned if needed as the hair is a bit weighty from length, but generally it stays on very well, but it might need a few pins if you plan on being active.  That’s normal for long wigs. You’d want to use blond ones with this wig.  The bangs cover the hairline well.<br /><br />As I mentioned, it is a bit weighty in the back from length - blonde bobby pins will help secure it if needed.  I recommend them for us with this wig.
11495	__label2__	4	N	Home Entertainment	B007F9XHBI	Sony DVPSR210P DVD Player (Progressive Scan)	A fine DVD player without the bells and whistles	This Sony DVD player is a very inexpensive option for a second or third home DVD player. We put in in our children's playroom for movie watching and it works fine for that purpose. This is not the choice for a main DVD player as it lacks any wifi capabilities for streaming Netflix, Pandora or You Tube. It is also ideal for a vacation home or furnished rental property. When it comes to DVD players today this one is as basic as it gets.
11496	__label2__	5	Y	Camera	B003ZUEYBS	Delkin DDSPROC7D-B Snug-it Pro Protective Camera Skin for Canon 7D	Tough and Considerably Thick Skin Offers Good Protection	I bought this for my Canon 7D and have had it for over 5 months. I wanted to protect my camera from nicks and scratches since I regularly bring my camera on my hikes -- and this skin does a good job of it.<br /><br />Pros<br />----<br />- Protection<br />The skin is very thick, which will not only protect the camera from nicks and scratches but help dampen the impact from bumps. (The thick skin does make the already large 7D a little pudgy.)<br /><br />- Durable<br />The skin's held up very well to all the frequent handling I subject it. There are no rips, tears, or any form of degradation. The previous skin I got for my Canon XSi held up to years of heavy use. This one looks to be equally durable.<br /><br />- Accurate Cutouts<br />The cutouts (for the screen, mode dial, lens mount, battery compartment, etc.) line up perfectly. Unlike my previous skin, this one lets me change lenses easily because the skin doesn't obstruct the area where the lens meets the mount.<br /><br />Cons<br />----<br />- Hard Screen Protector Slides Around<br />I'm worried the hard screen protector does more harm than good since it slides around and could potentially scratch the LCD screen (even if the LCD had a regular "soft" screen protector on since the very edges of the LCD aren't covered). Forget the Hard Screen Protector; a regular screen protector (included) will do the job just fine.<br /><br />- Buttons Not Clearly Labeled<br />This problem seems specific to only the skins for certain camera models. On the 7D, the labels on the buttons are imprinted as part of the molding, but they are barely legible.<br /><br />---<br />The Bottom Line: The Delkin Snug-it Pro is a well-made and durable product that offers the camera very good protection. The only shortcoming (for the skin for the Canon 7D) is the labels for the buttons are not clearly labelled (not a problem for me personally because I already know my way around the camera).
11497	__label2__	5	N	Automotive	B00LJ3BQUU	Griot's Garage (10615) Orange 6.5" Foam Correcting Pad	Removes Scuffs in no time flat, or use with compounds (to get rid of fine/mod scratches)	This pad reminds me of a very high quality &#34;Magic Eraser&#34; if you are familiar with those. It is designed to work with the Griot's Garage system.  It's 6 1/2 inches so it covers a good bit of area making the work go fairly quickly.<br />Alone, it will get scuffs off as well as very minor scratches, and with some rubbing compound, it will take out most fine or a tad bit deeper scratches.  It is machine washable and made in the USA.  It doesn't leave swirls or streaks at all.<br />It is very easy to remove what I call scuffs.  My truck is a pewter color and had some black scuffs on it. Using this pad, they were gone in just a few minutes and very little work.  It gives a really nice finish.
11498	__label2__	4	Y	Watches	B0058ZIOYG	Fossil Men's CH2782 Flight Brown Dial Watch	Somewhat Satisfied	It's a Fossil. Pretty hard to go wrong - but, the watch arrived running. Doesn't that make it "used?" Everything inside the face is brown, so it's kind of hard to read, especially at night. That's my only real complaint.  It would be nice if it had luminous hands, or a back light (like Timex's "indiglo") to compensate for the lack of  clarity.  The watch band is stiff - will take some breaking in, like new shoes. I had a cuff watch band that works beautifully with this watch, making it a striking looking watch. But, again, it would be nice to have greater clarity in the watch face.  I have several Fossil's and they are well made. The vendor did finally get back to me regarding shipping. So, overall - I will give it a 4, but not a 5.

It easier for kids to squeeze with the gun.
