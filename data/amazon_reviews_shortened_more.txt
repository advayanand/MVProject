It is very loud and doesn't swing very well. It is beautiful though. I love the colors and it has a lot of settings, but I don't think it was worth the money.

It works and does everything I need. Only issue is that it tilts slightly to one side so when I hit any keys it rocks a little bit. Not a big deal.
5	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B00PWSAXAM	Shine Whitening - Zero Peroxide Teeth Whitening System - No Sensitivity	Only use twice a week	I only use it twice a week and the results are great. I have used other teeth whitening solutions and most of them, for the same results I would have to use it at least three times a week. Will keep using this because of the potency of the solution and also the technique of the trays, it keeps everything in my teeth, in my mouth.

15	__label1__	4	N	Furniture	B0019QITHK	Boss Caressoft Medical Stool, black	Color Is Accurate	I bought 2 of these in brown for my island. The hydraulic mechanism looks as though it might fail with over use, but otherwise, I really like them. The color is accurate, as is the description. There is some padding, but not much. Definitely not a chair that you would lounge around in, but great for a bar/counter in the kitchen.

I only say this because due to where the left camera is place, there is wasted recording room when you start to turn it towards the driver side. Otherwise very happy with this so far.
18	__label1__	4	N	Sports	B000HE8NK8	Barnett Diablo Slingshot	good enough	As sling shots go, this is good enough for my purposes. Though, I would have preferred for the handle to be slimmer for better grip.

I take it before breakfast, lunch and supper. I don't take the one after supper because I don't tend to eat much in the late evenings. I find it really cuts my down my appetite. I've lost 8 lbs this month, which is WAY more than I've lost in a long time.

It's like they didn't test it to see if it works.
26	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B0018KL0YG	Oregano Oil CERTIFIED ORGANIC- Joy of the Mountain - 75% Carvacrol (30mL) Brand: Joy of the Mountain	Did you know? Oregano delivers more antioxidants than blueberries, oranges or apples	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/wa7AI ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />I was told the enormous benifit of Oregano: it is one of the most powerful healing herbs and natural anti-biotics ever studied. It has been found in a recent study to be significantly better than all of the 18 currently used anti-biotics in the treatment of MRSA staph infections. The strong phenol anti-oxidants destroy pathogenic bacteria, viruses and yeasts. This super herb is very rich in anti-oxidant phytochemical flavonoids and phenolic acids. It is the third highest herb in oxygen radical absorbancy capacity (ORAC) with an impressive score of 200,129. The USDA ranks oregano's antioxidant capacity anywhere from 3 to 20 times higher than any other herb.<br /><br />You can see 2 bottles Oreganol P73 in my fridge. Wowww ... this oregano oil is just the best, it works miraculously! I had discomfort and dryness in my throat, then I took a couple drops of this oil in a tablespoon of water and drank it. This oil healed and soothed my throat almost instantly, and feel great up to now. Another time I felt my body so aching, then I took this oil in the same way - it set me free and felt great just in seconds. This oil is fantastic!!! I also have used oregano as emergency medicine to completely eliminate digestive distress after eating what I found out was contaminated food.

We tried 2 before this one & took both back. You cannot feel the wires and the material is very luxurious. I did feel it was quite pricey...about $50 more than the ones we took back. However, that being said, the quality indicates it will last for years.

It will allow you to set your table very decoratively, and the beauty of a white dinnerware set is that it goes with any color scheme! Before acquiring this particular dinnerware set, I already owned a plain white set of dinnerware; but this set with the platinum rim is much nicer.

It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz	Since I have a low pain tolerance this facial hair remover didn't hurt very much. It did take a lot of hair off my face which I love because I hate peach fuzz, especially when wearing foundation. The tweezers were okay, loved the color but it was a little hard for me to use. Wish the package was bubble wrapped because it was so cute but mine got smashed in the process of shipping. Great customer service!!
35	__label1__	3	N	Camera	B0049I48JI	Nikon Deluxe Digital SLR Camera Case - Gadget Bag	hard to accommodate	The bag looks like a little smaller version than the one in the picture.

This mask is great for the purpose of keeping out the light for sure! My hubs gets up at 4am to go work and he is a butthead by turning on all the lights. Since getting this, Ive havent had any issues sleeping through it! lol. It looks like a mini bra because its not like your traditional flat sleep masks that lay flat over your eyes. This one has little &#34;cups&#34; that doesnt touch your eyelids at all which is nice because with my old sleep mask it made me itchy. The only reason why I didnt give this 5 stars is because whenever I turned to sleep on my sides it kinda made it uncomfortable to sleep with it on. I had to sleep on my back to make it stay on. For me I hate sleeping on my back so :(

39	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B005HXTMYA	Protocol For Life Balance - Red Yeast Rice Plus 600 mg 90 vcaps	The best natural product to lower cholesterol	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Zi8I , 600mg a tablet for only 5 cents, additional with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />Recent biochemical and pharmacological studies have identified red yeast rice as a beneficial supplement for maintaining a healthy balance of cholesterol and related lipids in the body. Studies have reported lowering of LDL and triglycerides while increasing HDL. A clinical study on patients who have suffered a heart attack found that a partially purified extract of red yeast rice, reduced the risk of repeat heart attacks by 45 revascularization (bypass surgery/angioplasty), cardiovascular mortality, and total mortality by one-third; and cancer mortality by two-thirds.<br /><br />A recent study has found that nattokinase combined with red yeast rice can significantly lower cholesterol. I use it with Best Nattokinase( goo.gl/32EeB ) and this does a fabulous job of reducing my LDL and overall cholesterol( from 220 to 150 ). Amazing!

41	__label1__	4	N	Beauty	B000F5PM4E	Elon Matrix 5,000 - Vitamin for Hair 60 tablets	My husband commented on how good my hair looks since I started this, thick, clear and even toned	My personal physician recommended it and I bought at goo.gl/5Hndv ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />My personal physician told me that Biotin's role is multi-faceted and the vitamin is used for a number of different purposes.<br />1) Hair, Skin, Nails: Biotin is said to help grow healthy hair, is good for the skin and is used to help treat brittle toe and fingernails. Biotin is also used to treat hair loss (alopecia), and for people with premature gray hair due to low levels of biotin, it has helped combat graying hair.<br />2) Treatment of Candida: Some people use biotin to treat Candida because it is said to be able to prevent yeast from changing into its fungal form.<br />3) Fat Burner: Biotin is often promoted as a "fat burner" because one of the principle roles of biotin is to help with the metabolism of fats, proteins and carbs.<br />4) Reduce Blood Sugar: In some cases, doctors recommend biotin to help people with type 2 diabetes reduce their blood sugar.<br />5) Gene Replication: On a deeper level, biotin is integral for gene replication.<br />6) Blood Cells and Bone Marrow: Biotin also helps in the production of healthy blood cells and bone marrow.<br /><br />My hair was thinning from working at a very stressful job. It had gotten to the point where I couldn't successfully make a ponytail. I decided to have a try. After using the Biotin for 3 months, I am happy to report stronger, thicker hair. I haven't seen much growth in the length, but it is very much thicker, prettier, and more manageable. It's so much so that my hairdresser was very surprised! When I went to her to get a trim 2 months after the last haircut, it had grown to the level which would normally have taken 3 months at least to reach :)

44	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B00028P640	Natural Factors Pycnogenol Pine Bark 25mg Capsules, 60-Count	The Gift of Life from Trees! Fountain of youth	My personal physician recommended this and I bought at goo.gl/xv1lP ,with $10 off and free samples. Great stuff!!!!!<br /><br />He told that the extract of pine bark has a beneficial effect in treating over 50 diseases associated with the effects of free radicals, and also provides prevention against them:<br />1) Asthma<br />2) Chronic venous insufficiency (a condition that involves leg swelling, 3) varicose veins, pain, itching, and other skin changes)<br />4) High blood pressure (hypertension)<br />5) Retinopathy (an eye condition commonly caused by diabetes)<br />6) Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)<br />7) Blood clots in the legs (deep vein thrombosis)<br />8) Diabetes<br />9) Impotence (also known as erectile dysfunction or ED)<br />10) High cholesterol<br />11) Male infertility<br />12) Heart attacks or strokes<br />13) Leg cramps<br />14) Pregnancy pains (such as back pain, pelvic pain, and leg cramps)<br />15) Painful menstrual periods (dysmenorrhea).<br />16) Pycnogenol is also said to improve athletic performance.<br /><br />"So, tell me what it cant heal?" I asked. But whatever I had a try. I use it in my type 2 diabetes herbal treatment regimen and to add preventative circulatory and longevity potential to my life one veggie cap at a time. I have been taking this pycogenol for about a month so far and the main thing I have noticed is that my allergies/cough have pretty much gone away completely. At the beginning of January this year I got sick with a pretty bad cold and have had a cough ever since that is only at night and in the morning. My doctor told me that it was most likely allergies or asthma, neither of which I have had before. The pycogenol is the only thing I have added to my regimen of vitamins/supplements in the past month and now my cough is gone.Yay!! I am also hoping this will help with my diabetes which was the reason that I started taking it so hopefully I can report back seeing a benefit on that soon too. I plan to starttaking this twice a day instead of once so I'm hoping that will help.

They probably should have asked me first what i thought, but here it goes. I bought it for use with my appradio3 and paid an additional $20 to have it installed. After about 2 days, it would not allow video to display constantly and just kept flashing between the warning message and the video about every 6 or 7 seconds. It was like one second of video followed by 6-7 seconds of warning message. It would do it over and over and got really annoying. I took it back to my installer, and they said it was installed correctly. I had no amps, or other stuff and my car does not need a radio module (older car here with no fancy computer stuff except for new pioneer radio). I agreed to an additional $30 removal to have the bypass bench tested and it did the same thing on the bench. The installer fed power to the blue and black wires, and connected an alarm led to the green wire. It did the same flashing on the bench it did in the car. For $20, i dont want to deal with the hassle of returning it, but it cost me more out of pocket and time to make it worth it. I do not know if the seller should be responsible for this, but i did lose out a lot of money due to their product so I am not sure if I should pursue it. I ended up buying another bypass from another company, and it has worked fine for over a month now. Maybe I just got a bad one or what, but it sucked to have to deal with it. Just my $.02 so take it or leave it. My emails to the company through their website still have went unanswered to date, and its been weeks. I searched online about this and diybypass is really a no-name company so go figure.

She can say circle and star now, and recognizes some others when she plays with her [[ASIN:B0089W1IGG Baby's First Blocks]]. She can also count from one to five, and names a few letters here and there.<br /><br />I give the videos credit that they hold her attention and she has learned a lot from them. They are slow paced and not too flashy like most cartoons on TV. The animations are colorful and the music is decent.<br /><br />However, they get boring for adults to watch. The videos repeat the word over and over again, which gets tiring for me to listen to. In all fairness the repetition definitely helps her to learn faster so I guess I should just deal with it.<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />* The videos work well.<br />* My daughter loves them.<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />* Boring for adults to watch.

114	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8JH9M	Pampers Cruisers Diapers Size 4 Economy Pack Plus,160 Count	Good for mobility	We changed from swaddlers to cruisers when our baby started to crawl excessively. The diapers moved with her better and gave a lot better coverage. Swaddlers were not so leak proof with an active baby. I think she also likes the these better- she seems to smile when she sees them. There've been some changes in the last pack compared to original cruisers though. There liner is the same color as the diaper again and they're thinner. Sometimes the thinner consistency poses a problem, sometimes it does not. It really depends on the day and how much she's gotta go.<br /><br />They seem to hold well overnight- no leaks, but it's not as dry either. As a result, our poor little Lucy has got some diaper rash a few times. She's a screamer when she's got it bad. In those instances we use a heavy strength rash cream by bourdeaux butt paste brand: [[ASIN:B00BMIT1U4 All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste Diaper Rash Ointment + FREE Aveeno Baby Daily Moisture Lotion]]. It absorbs well so it's not left all messy and residue on the diaper when you put a fresh one on. Anything still there at the next change wipes right off her bottom with ease too.

119	__label1__	4	N	Health & Personal Care	B004Q8LL9Q	Pampers Baby Dry Diapers Economy Plus Pack Size 1, 276 Count	Good diaper on the right baby	There's a lot of mixed reviews...I just want to start by saying each diaper is going to work differently on each baby! They're not all shaped the same, they don't all go to the bathroom the same. It takes patience to find the right diaper for your baby. Just because my friend prefers swaddlers doesn't mean I do too. The Pampers Baby Dry is a good fit for my child. She's pretty small and long. I've noticed my friends with fuller, thicker babies don't have as much good luck. But for me, this is a great, thin, super-absorbant diaper that works well. The price is a great value as well.<br /><br />Be aware though, no diaper will elimnate diaper rash! Despite how absorbant your diaper choice is, your baby will still at some point have diaper rash. My best luck has been butt paste diaper cream ([[ASIN:B00BMIVQ3E All Natural Boudreaux's Butt Paste + FREE Baby Ganics Thick N' Kleen (Fragrance Free) Baby Wipes]]) because it seals up the sensitive skin and I can still re-diaper my girl right away without a lot of fuss. With diaper rash and rash cream, make sure the diaper doesn't rub anywhere to hard and that they've got some flexibility. The Baby Dry leaves plenty of room for my baby.

I purchased Herbalife a few months ago at my local health retailer and had high hopes for this with the numerous good reviews I read. Although, after using it for 6 weeks fairly regularly, I was very disappointed.<br /><br />Normally people keep eating unhealthy or don't stay active during the use of these kinds of products, but I didn't do that at all. I honestly didn't lose more than 2 pounds at any time during the use of this product. It was hard to comprehend that even after that much regular use, I wasn't losing weight.<br /><br />After realizing this, I decided to try something new. After consulting with friends and family, I went with a product that has been nothing short of AMAZING. I have lost 23 pounds in the last 7 weeks and I have never felt better. This is only the start! I get emotional typing this because I struggled for so long to find something that worked for me.<br /><br />If you want to actually lose weight, take a look at this item here on Amazon and give it a chance ---------&#62; http://amzn.to/1jSaoQQ<br /><br />Even if you decide it's not the product for you, I'm at least glad I could share my experience about this product and how it did not work for me. I am walking proof that there is SOMETHING out there that works!

If you want a fast acting balm that doesn't have the real effect, don't buy this. If you want something that will take some time but bring long term results, this is the best balm on the market.

156	__label1__	2	N	Sports	B000UEP0NI	FitDeck Bodyweight	Full and Complete Review of Fit Deck Bodyweight	I am a collector of fitness products, there are three exercise cards on the market (Workout Labs, Strength Stack 52 and Fit Deck) and I will post a brief review of all three here. Just a bit about myself, I am 5 foot 10 somewhat athletic and would consider myself a little above average in terms of my fitness level.<br />Fit Deck<br />Fit Deck has been around for a few years now. I would place them second behind Strength Stack 52 in terms of the quality of workout you can get with these. They have a ton of different decks like bodyweight and basketball and even tai chi, to be fair, I only purchased the bodyweight cards though. Like Workout Labs the exercises were still very basic and lacked the neat gaming component that Strength Stack provides. The owner is a former navy seal (from many years ago), which helps the product, but if you look at him, he has very little muscle tone, which gets me a bit weary.<br />About $16/deck, not very happy with these since they lack any benefit for someone of intermediate or advanced fitness level. If you are a beginner and have no knowledge of working out, you can get these cards, but again, no reason to buy them if Strength Stacks are in stock.<br />Strength Stack 52<br />In my opinion the best of the three workout card companies. From the design to the game play, these cards have some really neat features. Every card has a QR code. The code can be scanned with any Smartphone and a video of the exercise on the card will show me how to do the exercise. Each card is numbered and suited and even color coded by body type. The website has some cool games you can play with the cards, but my buddy and I made up a few of our own. The inventor of the cards, Sergeant Volkin is a military fitness expert and you can tell by looking at him.<br />The best feature of these cards is the exercises themselves. Both Fit Deck and Workout Labs have very basic exercises, Strength Stack has exercises that are dynamic and fun, some of which I have neverseen before.<br />About $16/deck, really great deal, these are the cards I still use months after my purchase.<br />Workout Labs<br />This is the worst of the three exercise cards available. The creator of the cards has no muscle tone, no background in fitness or extraordinary fitness level (to my knowledge) , these cards are purely a marketing play as the owner outright claims he is a designer only. The cards are very, very basic, appealing only to beginners. When I got my cards in the mail, I noticed they were of good quality and waterproof in case you drip sweat on them. But, I have yet to sweat using these cards.<br />PLEASE NOTE: The reviews on this product are fake. I have clicked on almost all of the 5 star reviews and everyone one of them have only reviewed this product. You can even tell they are fake by the way they are written, a bit too perfect. That got me wary of purchasing the cards in the first place, but I still did.<br />The cards are divided into a male and female deck, which is  odd since fitness is unisex. There was nothing to do when I got the cards besides flip a card and look at the illustrations. Given the fact that they were $25 for a single deck of cards, I was hoping for much, much more as there are only 40 basic exercises in the deck. All in all, very disappointed with these.<br /><br />I hope this review helped, I was not paid in any way to review any of these companies.

I do a lot of running, and have recently began having some minor joint discomfort in my left knee and hip as a result of training for a marathon. After speaking with my Dr about the pain, he said that I should look at Glucosamine supplements to see if they could help. So over the past few months I have tried a few other products I found in GNC like Instaflex, and GNC's own Triflex and while I noticed a slight difference with each of them I just continued looking to find something that would help noticeably alleviate the pain. I hate taking aspirin and ibuprofen as they both have a tendency to upset my stomach, and like the fact that it is more natural. My running partner recommended this to me, and what I noticed was that it really helped with the pain. I wouldn't say that the relief came immediately, but over about a week I noticed that the pain in my joints was much less, and my joints began to have just a more &#34;smooth&#34; feeling while running. I don't know how else to describe it, but I just don't get that rough feeling I would usually get after a week of running. It is a bit more expensive than I would like which is why I only gave it 4 stars, but I have to admit it has really helped me out.

The look and feel of them is cool but there is definitely work to be done if these are to be sold for $100.<br /><br />After dealing with these I got myself a good headset that I absolutely love. The sound quality is great and I haven't found a single thing to complain about in over two months of use. I can wear them for hours on end with no issue!<br /><br />If you want a great headset, check out this pair here on Amazon -----------&#62; http://amzn.to/1qp9Fhd<br /><br />I hope I could help others out by sharing my experience with these headsets, you won't regret getting the pair I did!

For a long time I began to let those things slip away because I was constantly in pain and aching.

Any tribulus product that contains 45% Saponins, is simply not going to compare to a tribulus that contains a high concentration of Protodioscin (the main ingredient responsible for the benefits I gets when taking tribulus).  The most potent form of tribulus is extracted at a ratio of 90%, [[ASIN:B007RLZDBQ Tribulus Terrestris 90% Bulk Powder 50 Grams]].  Even than I would still recommend combining it with some longjack or DAA, if increasing testosterone levels is your main motivation for taking it in the first place.

10502	__label2__	5	N	Toys	B00ICAKJJW	Power Wheels Nickelodeon Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Kawasaki KFX	Great fun for little ones. But be sure you fully charge before use.	This is probably one of the most exciting gifts you can give to a young child. Most kids are fascinated with the concept of driving. So having a little vehicle they can safely maneuver is awesome. We purchased this type of vehicle for all 3 of my kids. Everyone of them was thrilled. In fact, we parked them inside the garage facing forward as though they were &#34;parked&#34;.<br />This one sits a little high, so the child has to climb up to get on it. But they won't mind.<br />I would highly recommend elbow pads and a helmet. Though we've not seen our 4 wheeler turn over on us yet, but there were a couple of times going over some big bumps on the hilly areas that it looked as though it might tip. So steer your kids away from really bumpy areas and stay on mostly level ground. This is not a TRUE 4 wheeler. It is not designed for rough terrain. It is a TOY.<br />When it first arrives at your house, it might be best not to let the little ones know it's there. It has to be partly assembled and charge overnight (you have to plug it in) before it can be used. If you charge it less than the recommended time, the battery will never hold a charge for long.<br />Being that it runs on an oversize battery, it's only good for about 20 minutes of constant riding before it starts to lose some power.

My eyes tend to get really dry and itchy. I have a habit of rubbing my eyes, which just makes them worse. I've started using these drops when I feel the urge to rub my eyes, and they are great. They are soothing going in and my eyes don't feel dry or itchy for a while afterwards. I probably use them about 3 - 4 times a day, sometimes more when the weather is really dry. Now I just wish they made Similasan sinus drops.

This one is nice and slim and doesn't add too much bulk to the iPhone.  We've unfortunately dropped the phone several times already, even on the concrete garage floor no damage and very minimal scuffing of the case.<br />Camera and buttons are all accessible with no interference from the shell.<br />Comfortable in the hand texture-wise.<br /><br />My only real beef is the price.  It seems customers get bent over the barrel a bit when a new iPhone comes out.  An equivalent new-android phone case can be gotten for less than half the price, and tempered glass screen protectors are routinely under ten bucks.  The &#34;layers of radial impact geometry&#34; seems kind of gimmicky, when the other pure silicon Speck and off-brand cases I've owned have done as well of a job.

This system is so much nicer and does not have a use by date so I am guessing it will last longer than the Continental system. In addition the Continental system will damage the Tire Pressure Monitors in your wheel where the Slime system says it will not. It has a nice light and is easy to use. I am hoping I never need it but it is comforting to know I have it in my Corvette which does not have a spare tire. It came fairly quicky and has a nice carry case with a reflective triangle on the back of the case to place while you are fixing the tire.

I can understand the premise and I like the premise.<br />However, I just don't believe that these bibs are comfortable for baby.<br /><br />While they are not hard, they are not soft.<br /><br />The Oxo Tot Roll Up bib has a truly soft front with a catch for whatever doesn't make it into baby's mouth.  It also has a flat velcro closure as opposed to Babybjorn's plastic snap closure.<br /><br />Babybjorn can be cleaned off easier, while Oxo would need to be washed when truly soiled.<br />But...Oxo can be rolled up for travel.

Sadly, though they have faded down a bit because of the Drive 2.0 & 3.0 collections, where they have catered so much on the young, that the appeal of their class has died in the process. But they are trying to make a returning stance in great appeal watches. This WDR Eco-Drive watch is definitely a great return to the appeal Citizen had been known for throughout the years. What I also like about the watch is the excellent illumination on the hands, and the globe-style face on the watch. It definitely stands up very well. It is a elequent piece that looks great, and keeps great time on the wrist, without much worry. I suggest you go for this dark-tone piece, and see why Citizen for years has been known as being a world class.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: B 1/2-<br /><br />Overall: B

Not just in style, but the quality has gotten better with the time they have made with the way we view time. Their Seiko Sportura watches are definitely in the ranking. This watch is a very simple and easy to care leather-strapped watch. I personally like how simple it is to read the stopwatch setting with the comfort of the strap around my wrist. It is a very strong watch that does what it is worth, and protects great  in water. I definitely recommend this watch if you are looking for a great watch that is sporty, and fine like china while telling time. Seiko has done that for years, and the Sportura is definitely following in suit like their other models have.<br /><br />Price: B<br /><br />Comfort: B+<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2+

I can get two filters for the price of one from the Ranch store in town, same thing. I have two riding mowers as I have 5 acres to mow every spring.  Your mower has to breath, this is so important.

10518	__label2__	1	Y	Pet Products	B002AI39QW	Epi-Pet Sun Protector Spray for Pets	Dangerous dog sunscreen!!!	Very dangerous dog sunscreen!!! I bought this for my hairless Chinese Crested dog and had to take him to the vet.  Do your homework about dog sunscreens because some have toxic ingredients like this one(Benzophenone-3) which can cause contact eczema & absorbs into the body and does not process out.  Zinc oxide is toxic for dogs.Harmful ingredients are triethanolamine, Imidura, Methyl Paraben, DMDM Hydantoin.  Titanium dioxide is a good ingredient but the SAFEST is organic sunscreens for babies containing sunflower/jojoba seed oils, green tea leaf extracts, calendula flower/gingko leaf extracts, aloe juice, vitamin E, with titanium dioxide.  I'm looking at some brands at a local Whole Foods store which should be good.  Read the label carefully and I hope this helps you choose wisely.

Included is a chain guard, a user manual and a wrench conveniently stored in the handle of the saw. The battery was not fully charged but nearly so and took a short time to bring it up to a full charge. All I had to do was add some bar and chain oil and the saw was ready to go.<br /><br />There have been a number of storms the past few months and they broke off numerous branches and downed one very large tree. I have been doing some cleanup with a Stihl gas powered saw and a 40 volt Ryobi. They do a fairly nice job on the branches but not so good on the big tree. I slipped on my goggles and hauled this bad boy out to the big tree.  I started of with the trunk size of about 14 inches. This saw was nothing less than amazing as it cut through the tree trunk like a hot knife through butter. I continued until the tree was cut up and then worked on some branches and some trimming. This saw never slowed down and the battery just kept on keeping on.<br /><br />This is now my saw of choice. No more mixing oil and gas for the Stihl and no more charging the battery for the Ryobi. From now on it is just charge the Greenworks battery and keep a supply of bar and chain oil on hand.<br /><br />Yes, this saw does dribble a bit of oil as did the Ryobi and as did every chainsaw I ever owned. That is no big deal. All you need to do is slip some old newspaper or some rags or whatever under the saw when storing it and then check the oil level before the next use and you are good to go.
10522	__label2__	5	Y	Video DVD	B003QF1N7K	Disneynature: Oceans	Wonderful DVD	This DVD is awesome. I love the way that it shows all different kinds of life in the Ocean. Especially that of the Dolphins and the Whales. Finding out about the rays, sharks and many other things that live in the ocean is just as impressive. Just amazing. Simply Wonderful.
10523	__label2__	5	N	Office Products	B00D7NYKYE	Quartet Chalkboard, 8.5 x 11 Inches, Wood Finish Frame (80214)	Perfect for the Kitchen	Roughly the size of a notebook paper, this little chalkboard is incredibly handy.  It mounts easily to any surface with the included double sided tape.  We use it in the kitchen for reminders and little notes.  It is very light weight.  The faux wood edges look nice as well.  We're happy with this product.

Should offer great protection for day to day usage. I would not try placing heavy items on top of this case, though. It may do fine but why risk it?<br /><br />Construction seems very good.

I am amazed at just how much wire goes in to wiring a small room... expect on just over 100' for a 12x12 room if you run it semi-hidden for a 5.1 system. Better get two spools for a 7.1, especially if you have a larger room.
10526	__label2__	1	Y	PC	B003X0BHOW	Dragonpad Elan Folio for Ipad Black	Awful awful scent	Fits the first generation iPad perfectly. No complaints there. It just had this horrible, awful scent that would not go away. I can't even describe it - just smelled like awful, cheap leather and my fingers would reek after touching it. Ended up throwing it out because it was so gross.

10529	__label2__	5	Y	Outdoors	B00BLORPGG	Baofeng 2013 Newest Dual Band VHF and UHF Walkie Talkie, 5-watt, Black	Great for the price	I've been an Amateur Radio Operator for many years, and have more radios than I'll ever need. But when I see these Baofeng radios for under $50, I can't help myself. I already own the popular Baofeng UV-5R, and the new UV-B5 is even better. The UV-B5 feels more like a quality radio than the UV-5R. Most of the features are similar. The UV-B5 has slightly less channels (99), but has a channel knob instead of the LED flashlight. Programming is a little easier, but like the UV-5R, you'll want to buy the optional programming cable. Using the software from Baofeng, you can also expand the UHF RX frequency range to 520MHZ. The latest daily builds of CHIRP also work, but not the advanced settings or programming above 470MHZ (as of June, 2013). The UV-B5's operating manual is light years better than the operating manual that comes with the UV-5R, and also has a much better antenna.<br /><br />Performance wise, the UV-B5 is on par with my radios costing 3 times more. Transmit and receive are both excellent. Build quality is a step below the more expensive Japanese radios, and the scan speed is slower, but that should be expected from a dual-band radio costing under $50. Audio is excellent, and plenty loud from the small speaker. The 2000mAh battery lasts a long time. Unfortunately, the battery and charger are not compatible with the UV-5R. The programming cable is.<br /><br />This is just a great, cheap, dual-band radio.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Price!!<br />Very good audio on TX and RX.<br />Good battery life.<br />Good sensitivity and selectivity.<br />Great features.<br /><br />Cons:<br />As of June 2013, radio is still only available from overseas dealers.<br />Programming cable not included.<br />Very quirky programming without the cable.<br />Channel skip is only available using the programming software.<br />SMA Female antenna instead of standard SMA Male antenna.<br />Very slow scan speed.
10530	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B00DOMOCCI	The Reservoir, Emergency Water Storage System 100 Gallons	100-gallon Bathtub Water Emergency Preparedness System "The Reservoir"	This is a very handy Preparedness option if you want to fill your bathtub with safe, potable drinking water (in advance, while water pressure is still available). These are widely offered all over the Internet at prices from $18 up. These are essentially just giant vinyl bags with a nozzle/cap closure. The same exact bag seems to be sold under various brand names, but it's the same product.    I like this simple concept. Here are some points to consider:    1. Water weighs 8 pounds per gallon. Once full (even partially full), this thing will weigh a ton. Completely full, 100 gallons weighs 800 pounds.  It's not portable. You're not going to be lifting it out of the tub and carrying it anywhere. The vinyl would likely not survive 800 lbs of stress even if you had the manpower to lift it.    2. Once it's in place and full, your bathtub (and/or shower) are out of action and can't be used for anything else...like bathing, or decontaminating anything. So this works best if you have multiple bathrooms/tubs in order to spare one for water storage.    3. These are one-time-use items. Once you use it, and empty it, the vinyl bag is just too large to dry thoroughly after it's emptied. So there's that. On the other hand, 100 gallons of water (at 1 gallon per person per day) is a great resource.    4. If portability is a concern, you can achieve much the same thing using clean large plastic storage bins (Sterilite brand or similar) and stacking those in the tub. Same concept but capable of being moved if necessary.    SUMMARY: If you have a bathtub you can afford to dedicate solely to water storage in an emergency, this is a fast, easy, simple and clever solution to hold 90 days+ of survival water for one person, 45+ days for 2 people, etc. It pays to comparison shop on price. It's large, and a challenge to dry to dry out hygienically for possible re-use (consider a blow dryer and a funnel?), so I consider this a 100-gallon 'disposable'. On the whole, at around $20, this is a great solution at a low price for 100 gallons. Just make sure you have a tub you are willing to dedicate solely to water storage.    Hope this is helpful. Stay safe and happy trails, everybody.    PS: I just read reviewer Jennifer Gonzales's comments that people often overlook that they already have a ready source of clean emergency water in their home water heater. That's very true, and good to remember. There are lots of good how-to videos on YouTube on this--you'll just need to know in advance which valves are involved, and most units will need a crescent wrench to open the faucet type drain at the base of the heater.
10531	__label2__	4	N	Watches	B0066T2IAY	Fossil Men's JR1357 Nate Chronograph Black Leather Watch	Beautiful large watch with easy to read clean face	As a watch lover, this watch is a beautiful piece to wear and enjoy.  This is a large watch, the face is 50mm across, and about 53mm when you include the protruding hands and timer buttons.  I've had my watch a few months now and it's accurate and keeps good time.  The day counter does need to be adjusted forward when there's less than 31 days in a month.  The watch bezel rotates counter clockwise and clicks to lock in place.  Oddly enough it has 7 clicks for each 5 minutes, which really isn't an issue because it does line up on each 5 minute indicator.<br /><br />The band is very thick and robust leather.  The band is about 3mm thick and thus about as thick as the buttons that stick out on the right side.  One great feature of the band is that it includes the really simple to use Fossil release slider on each half.  On the under-side where it connects to the watch case there is a small spring loaded tab you simply side one way to release the bands.  This makes them easy to trade out for many of the other available options.  For example Fossil sells a silicone rubber band that I also enjoy and it's a simple process to make the change.  This opens up the option of having different colors for different looks and or outfits or occasions.<br /><br />The watch has a timer which will keep track by the second up to 30 minutes.  There's a second hand timer (bottom center dial) in addition to the sweep second hand.  There's a 30 minute small counter (upper left small dial).  The upper right small dial is a 24 hour time that shows you which hour of 24 the watch is showing.  I like the sweep second hand and appreciate that since many watches no longer have that.  The top button is the "start/stop" timer function.  The lower button is the "reset" button once you've stopped the timer.<br /><br />One of the additional features this watch includes is that any of the Fossil stores will replace the battery for $10 and guarantee it for a year.  That's a pretty nice benefit when manywatch shops can charge $30 or more for a new battery.<br /><br />This is a large watch, you need to keep it up on your wrist a little to keep the button protrusions from bumping into your wrist as you bend your wrist.  If you had a job where there was a risk of a possible snag or catch risk I would suggest a smaller watch.  Of course the trend now is for these larger watches.  This one is very easy to read with a clean simple font for the face.  The internal characters are very clean cut from what appears to be raised plastic and have a nice 3D look.<br /><br />4 stars for a beautifully crafted watch that I enjoy wearing.

10534	__label2__	4	N	Toys	B00IQ8MTH0	Fisher-Price Little People Place Musical Preschool Playset	A fun preschool set!	I rated Fisher Price Little People set 4 stars because it is a cute musical preschool play set. I am generally happy with all the Little People sets I have and this is a great addition. I love how they designed it to look like a preschool with a teacher and 2 students, which you can add your other little people to the set also. The art easel, fish aquarium, round rug, hamster wheel, table/chairs, and slide are all items that make up a great preschool setting!<br /><br />The magical color rug doesn't really teach colors but sounds of each musical instrument which can be combined with pressing one other band instrument. The center of the rug is the teachers voice where she asks different questions and has a short conversation with you like; &#34;It's time for Ms. Hugs magical rug! what can you find? Come back soon!&#34;<br /><br />I didn't rate it 5 stars because although it states on the box over 35 sounds, phrases and songs, it seems half that amount. There should be more phrases added and could see this toy being tiresome after a short while. So I think I'll put it away and bring it out every couple weeks for a short time to play with so that it remains a &#34;new&#34; feeling toy.<br /><br />Overall, this Little People preschool set is a lot of fun which offers lots of opportunities to learn and pretend play. If your looking to add to your current collection or just start one of Little Poeple play sets, this is a good one!

After a while, this got so hot, it melted the plastic and warped it so bad the Rigid "Power" Spin was destroyed.  This should be renamed to "Flimsy Melt" Spin instead.  A drain cleaner that can be powered by drill or motor should always be made of metal, not plastic.  I recommend General Pipe Cleaners R-25SM instead, which is built MUCH tougher and still reasonably priced.

They are really bright and 20 come made up in one component.  I'll drive them with a Solar charged battery and little wind generator and turn them on and off with a motion PIR controller.  This is one of the best bargains in LED lighting I have found.  Very much worth the money paid.  Very satisfied.  Can be purchased in bulk at a considerable savings per 20 strip units of Three little LEDs per strip.  Get one and play with it. The plastic, which absorbs heat and then melts needs to be removed and replace with something to remove the heat, air circulation is a must.

But it's equally intriguing to see him hold back in her presence.<br />Jon Foster, Russell Crowe, and the other cast members do well in their roles, although the motives as mentioned above may leave you scratching your head.
10541	__label2__	4	Y	Video Games	B00BI9MDSO	AmazonBasics Heavy-Duty Vault Case for PlayStation Vita and Vita Slim (Officially Licensed by Sony)	Solid case	This is a really good case and I feel like my Vita would be adequately protected if I were to drop this case (not that I'd TRY, mind you, but I feel secure with it in this case).<br /><br />That said,  I have a couple of wishes:<br /><br />1.  The case can hold 3 game cartridges and 1 memory card.  I WISH that it could hold 6 and no memory card.  I have a 32 GB card and I don't intend on switching these out.<br />2.  I wish it had a detachable strap...even a hand strap would be great.  The case is fairly large and carrying it for extended periods means you need to have a secure grip on it.<br /><br />Other than that, top marks - great case!
10542	__label2__	5	N	Beauty	B001CSOBWW	MAKE UP FOR EVER Smoky Lash	Great mascara.	I love this mascara. Black is super black, lashes get volume, length and stayed curled (but I use eyelash curler before).<br />There is no flaking at the end of the day.<br />The only thing is that less is better-I use it first on the end of lashes and if I feel like I want more dramatic look apply one more coat from the bottom of the lashes. But usually 1 coat is enough.<br /><br />Waterproof Smoky lashes is excellent too, truly water resistant (have to wait till is dry to go the pool).

10544	__label2__	5	N	Grocery	B00JX9HMXM	V8: V-Fusion Peach Mango Juice, 46 Fl Oz(Pack of 4)	Tasty and Healthy ~ Great with Seltzer, Too!	If you are wanting to get more vegetables in your diet, these fusion drinks which combine fruit juices with vegetable juices are a savvy way to do so. This peach mango mixes the juice of sweet potatoes, yellow tomatoes, and yellow carrots with the juice of white grapes, apples, oranges, peaches and mango puree. You really taste the peach-mango flavor with the other subtle flavors as nuances.<br /><br />It is 100% juice with no ADDED sugar. However, it does include natural fruit sugar, as all juices do, which is part of the fruit juice - 26g sugar in a one cup serving. What I like to do is use about 1/8 cup - which would be about 3.5g of fruit sugar and 20 calories - and put it in a cup of seltzer with ice to make a refreshing and healthy drink. One cup of this fruit-vegetable fusion drink is 120 calories, but you can dilute it with seltzer to give it fizz and less calories for a refreshing, healthy and tasty beverage. It provides 100% of daily vitamin C and 20% vitamin A in one serving.<br /><br />It's a great concept to mix fruit and vegetable juices in a healthy fusion drink like this which is naturally delicious. Of all the V8fusion drinks, this is one of my favorites. Mango and peach together are so refreshing and rather tropical tasting.
10545	__label2__	5	Y	Books	0062202715	Nothing Gold Can Stay: Stories	Interesting, Intriguing and Often Surprising	I enjoyed each and every one of these stories. Ron Rash has a way with words and his stories are interesting, intriguing and often surprising.<br /><br />In The Trusty, a prisoner gets loose and with the help of a woman he sees his way to freedom only to have things turn on him in the end.<br /><br />In Cherokee, Danny goes to a casino hoping to win enough money to pay off his debt. He and his wife check in to the hotel and Danny carefully plays the slot machines.<br /><br />A man who considers himself a 'Servant of History' looks into the etiology of songs. His search for these beginnings ends up turning around and harming him.<br /><br />Those Who Are Dead Are Only Now Forgiven was one of my favorite stories in the collection. A college student is in love with Lauren who has turned into a meth-head. He tries to free her from her addiction but ends up giving himself to her and her demons.<br /><br />The Dowry is another of my favorites. A family is totally against the marriage of their daughter and is about to kill her fiance when a pastor steps in to make things right and evens up the score.<br /><br />All of the stories have panache and I read them aloud to my husband as we were driving. It was great to hear the words spoken and to share the book with someone else. It is a welcome addition to Rash's repertoire of works and I plan to read his other short stories soon. For those of you who enjoyed 'Serena', these stories will not be disappointing.
10546	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B004D4SW5O	ViSalus Body By Vi Challenge Shape Kit, 48 meals, 10 mix-ins	I love these shakes	I have never been a big fan of custom diets.  I have tried many before and got tired of the same thing over and over again.  I had some friends that were part of the cult that is ViSalus and kept trying to sell me on the product.  I finally broke down and bought it on Amazon instead of through them because it was cheaper and I am not being bothered to reorder and such.  Now for the product review:<br /><br />I love these shakes.  I am moderately active to begin with.  I play baseball once a week, I like to go outside and do yard work and I also have a woodshop that involves carrying heavy pieces of machinery and lumber around.  However I was 6'0&#34; and 205 pounds and really needed to drop some weight.  I thought 10 or 20 pounds would be good and I'd be fine.  Well after losing 20 in just a little over 2 months, I am now almost down 30 in just over 3 months and very happy with the results.<br /><br />It tells you to drink 2 shakes a day and a sensible meal but let's be honest, we humans love food.  I did the opposite of what everyone tells you, which is to get on the scale once a week or once a month.  I get on everyday.  Morning and night.  I really wanted to track my habits and how I lost each day.<br /><br />I found the best thing for me is a bowl of Quaker Oatmeal in the morning (brown sugar maple), a shake for lunch (look on pinterest and find shake recipes), and a sensible meal like a turkey sandwich or wrap or salad or something at night.  If I wanted a snack I will eat something like an apple with peanut butter or some Special K cracker chips or something healthy.  I was not extremely careful in calorie counting but I do go over my options and choose the best one.  Don't get me wrong, you will want food, food, and more food while on this diet.  Just as you will with any diet.<br /><br />The shakes are not that great by themselves.  Tastes like a typical protein shake.  I mix it with almond milk and other ingredients and come up with a less than 200 calorieshake that tastes great.  My favorite for instance is 2 scoops of powder, one cup of almond milk, 1 tablespoon of PB2(look this stuff up, it's awesome), 1 tablespoon of chocolate Fat free Jello pudding mix, and one teaspoon of caramel flavoring.  Throw in a handful of ice cubes and blend and it tastes like a snickers.  As I said before, you can look on pinterest or other sites and find recipes for different shake flavors that are great and PB2 instead of peanut butter provides half the calories and fat.<br /><br />So all in all, I would highly recommend this diet for someone that knows how to stick to a diet.  I lost 20 pounds in over 2 months with no time at the gym.  After that 20 it was a little harder to lose so I now work out about 3 times a week and I feel and look great.  I am still losing but I am also adding muscle so I don't notice the weight drop as much but it's still there.  All with just one shake a day instead of 2.

Great for use at Home, Work, Travel and Outdoors. Exclusive 1-Year Warranty (Comes In Retail Packaging)	Great Value	This case is a nice value for the money. It certainly isn't the fanciest case out there, but it is very nice considering the low cost.<br /><br />When &#34;tenting&#34; your ipad there are 4 different options for height, so you have plenty of options for positioning. The cover latches closed and does not come off on its own - a feature I appreciate when travelling with the ipad. I don't have to worry about something being able to get in contact with the screen and scratching it. They way the ipad fits into the case is also secure, so you do not need to worry about your ipad falling out of the case.
10548	__label2__	4	N	Home	B00A2VND0Q	Eureka AirSpeed Pet Bagless Upright Vacuum, AS1002A	Strong Suction, light to push	I found this vacuum easy to put together.  It has a lot of attachment pieces but the main vacuum was not hard at all, then the pieces just snapped in.<br /><br />It IS heavy and I'm glad that I have a single story house.  I don't think I'd want to carry it up and down stairs.  However, once you turn it on, it practically pushes itself so it is very good at self propulsion.  The suction is incredible.  It is loud, but it does suck up the junk.<br /><br />Features I like:  I love that it has a knob to turn to change from bottom suction to the attachments.  It's a nice feature that makes work a bit easier.  It has a pet paw for doing upholstery with a nice long reach, and the cord is long too.  The canister is easy to empty and put back for me, but is not designed nearly as well as the Hoover Bagless T-Series canister. I love that they've painted the ON/OFF lever RED and have it so that you can kick it with a foot.  I review a lot of vacuum cleaners and it is so nice just to be able to FIND the on/off switch so quickly, and sometimes when you are working, you suddenly see a Lego or something in the floor and the lever switch will let you turn it off quickly before you damage a belt.  The cord is very long and I suppose it is too much to wish it would retract.  It's nice be able to cover my central hall AND my living room.  It  has HEPA filtration, which is great for allergy sufferers.<br /><br /> Out of the box this does seem to have a bit more suction than most vacuums in this price range. I've used it about a month and haven't noticed a decrease, if it doesn't last over time, I'll update this review.<br /><br />MY DISLIKES:  It's bulky and big to store, and it is heavy.  While this is not a problem PUSHING it, it might be if you need to carry it around. Replacement filters for the HEPA filtration system might be expensive.  I wish the cord was retractable.  I don't see a way to turn the brushes off for hardwood floors.

10551	__label2__	5	Y	Beauty	B008HBMRRS	Burt's Bees Intense Hydration Day Lotion, 1.8 Ounces	Perfectly moisturized	My new favorite face lotion. I was a long time user of Olay, but the changed the formula of my usual brand and I didn't like the perfumy odor. My skin is sensitive to begin with so I'm always reluctant to try another brand--it's usually 50/50 as to whether my skin will break out. I wanted to try something more on the natural/organic side as well. Having used Burt's Bees products before I took a chance. I am so glad I did. It is thick, creamy, and light once you rub it in. I have been using it for almost a month and NO break outs. In fact I think my skin even looks better, it feels moisturized. You also do not need to use a lot. One pump is all you need, and even that a little too much...so I just rub the excess on my hands. I am very impressed by this lotion. I did not expect it to feel this good and most importantly no residue!

10553	__label2__	5	Y	Health & Personal Care	B00062N428	German EKG Caliper	great for fine woodworking and precision joinery	I got these on a whim.  I needed a set of accurate dividers for fine woodworking projects that involved copying and transfering small measurements - at the level of a few thousandths.  The human eye can recognize irregularities at that level and errors can destroy the aesthetics of the project.  I thought about getting a set of Groz calipers that comes with a divider, but I already had inside and outside calipers and i didn't want to spend $50 just to get a divider.  Then i came by this EKG caliper as an Amazon add-on for $6.31 so i got it.<br /><br />These calipers are great.  they are very well made and very sturdy.  Their maximum span is 7.5", but the effective usable span is more like 7", so they're not well suited for cabinet work, cutting sheet stock, and wood turning.  But for precision joinery, laying out dovetail joints, duplicating precise dado's, etc. these are just the ticket.  The arm tension is adjustable via two small set screws, and the points are replaceable.  These points are sharp and may also serve as an occasional light-duty scribe.  The points are protected with a convenient hard plastic cover which works fine.  My cover fits tightly enough to stay on in my pocket, but caliper placement in woodworking is primarily an out-of-pocket experience, so tightness doesn't matter much.<br /><br />At $6 these calipers are a great deal for anyone who needs to measure, transfer or step off small distances, scribe small circles, create simple geometrical patterns, etc.  The advantages over standard flat leg dividers for woodworking are that these dividers are precision-made, the points are ground to a precise center, and that they firmly hold their span for duplicating measurements, where most of woodworking dividers I'm familiar with use a threaded cap to hold the span which is far less convenient.  This would also be useful in metalworking small objects on mills, lathes, etc. which I don't do any more.  It will not replace the Trammel point - but for smallmeasurement, this is simpler and more accurate.<br /><br />This might also be useful with navigational charts, small part duplication, accurate metalworking, etc.  A very inexpensive and handy tool well beyond its intended uses.

This makes them stand too far off of the wheel rim.<br />Combine with the valve stem, the thickness of the light unit, plus the plastic light tube, and this could only really be used on a very small wheel.  Using on 26&#34; wheels, these bend off to the side, back and forth.<br /><br />Also, these are all plastic, with poor clearances.  You won't keep water, dust, and air off of the valves with these.
10555	__label2__	4	N	Lawn and Garden	B00IR99G7Y	#1 Barbecue Grill Light with 10 Super Bright LED Lights - Durable, Weather Resistant, Versatile LED BBQ Lights for Outdoor Grilling (Black)	BBQ's best invention (if only it was weather proof!)	[[VIDEOID:8712406df7dc5717aaeb927ed7c07d07]] No more burned meat! This happens way too much: I awkwardly shine a flashlight on my steak, it looks done, I bring it inside, cut it open... and it still needs another 5 minutes.  This light has saved me much annoyance.<br /><br />Pros:<br />- It actually fits perfectly on my BBQ.  I was very stoked.<br />- Lights up the entire grill with brilliant blue LED light.<br />- Comes with 3 AA batteries in box (not all companies do that! But obviously Brigmon does!)<br />- Black color stays out-of-sight (as opposed to a bright white colored light)<br />- Once installed it stays secure.<br />- The people at Brigmon are very nice folks (they're the ones who sent me this light to review and test. A lot of sellers sell this light on Amazon, but I would suggest going through these nice folks.)(no I don't work for them... they really are friendly).<br /><br />Cons:<br />- Have to take it off/on if you're not using it (see note below).<br /><br />Note: If you live in a warm climate (e.g. CA or AZ), then by all means this is a must-have.  However for my personal use here in the PNW weather, I must take this on/off to use it because I don't want it to get ruined in the rain. Or if you have a rain cover, just tuck this underneath (if it fits).<br /><br />Overall, a 4/5 stars product.  Really if you love to BBQ, this is a must-have toy.  (I guess it'd make a great gift too)

I put a different pad on it though because the one that comes with it is a bit like a sponge and I didn't want to come to the tree and sit on a wet sponge. I didn't actually test its porosity but it sure looks like a sponge and I didn't want to find out the hard way.

The only problem is that the gloves get a bit sweaty and stick to hands when being pulled off  (unlike the other brand I bought on Amazon last year). I also got a bit of a rash in the base of my thumb, probably from sweat. But the warmth does help with arthritis.

The numbers on the pivot points really help with remembering alternate configurations.  The fans are a bit noisy at times but nothing terrible. The side platform is nice to have but I decided not to use it just yet. The 2 plastic clamps go along the bottom edge and help hold your laptop in place when tilting the table at extreme angles.

Once I received it and read the label I was very disappointed to learn this contains sulfates the evil enemy of Keratin users.<br />This suds up nicely and smells great.

10565	__label2__	3	N	Video DVD	B00C1LIYWM	Safe Haven	Nicholas Sparks Romance with Just a Little Bit of Mystery	Julianne Hough is Katie, a young woman on the run from her past. Katie boards an Atlanta-bound bus, and gets off impulsively at Southport, a beautiful coastal town in North Caroline. There she meets Alex (Josh Duhamel), kind-hearted manager of a grocery store, and starts a new life. Little does she know, however, that her past is slowly catching up with her in the form of a Boston police detective (David Lyons), who seems to know something about her.<br /><br />“Safe Haven” is a Nicholas Sparks adaptation, which may tell you a few things about the film. Directed by Lasse Hallström (who also helmed a Nicholas Sparks romance “Dear John” a few years ago), “Safe Haven” is not surprisingly very romantic, but his new film does not stop there.<br /><br />For “Safe Haven” attempts to be a “mystery” – in more than one sense in this case. There are a few surprises in the story, but they are just a little less impactful than they could have been, as the story is told with little to no build up or nuance. Several supporting characters, Katie’s neighbor Jo (Cobie Smulders) for example, could have been more intriguing with a few clues as to why she gets interested in Katie.<br /><br />The film is overlong and its mid-section drags, but the film is not boring for the most part of it. After all this is a Nicholas Sparks tale and he sure knows how to spin a romantic tale.

Diecast heat-sinks and  a good lens make for a nice bulb. I'm happy with my purchase and at this price definitely recommend it.

I can still pull the compressor off the hand truck easily, for times when I don't need to extra tank and just want to put the compressor in the truck or something like that.

10570	__label2__	5	N	Furniture	B00IKWTLC8	Chelsea DSW Molded Plastic Dining Side Chairs (Set of 2) (White, DSW Side Chair)	Comfy, easy to assemble and great for any room.	Extra chairs are something I've been in need of for a while. Something versatile is always good, and these chairs from Chelsea Eames Style certainly fit the bill. They can be assembled in minutes, are pretty sturdy and are comfortable to sit in for any length of time. Looking at them in the stock images, they might not look like much. When you're sitting in one, however, you might want to switch out your old computer desk chair for one of these. Plastic chairs will probably always look 'kiddy' no matter how you look at it, appearing as the kind of thing you'd see in an elementary school. I actually like how the chairs look in-person, and wouldn't be against getting another set because of how reliable they are.<br /><br />The chairs come packed in one box, and in a way where it's practically impossible for them to get damaged during shipping. They have little foam covers on the screw holes, and all the tools are included in a little bag, one taped to each chair. Yep, everything you need to assemble these is included! Assembly only takes a couple of minutes once everything is out of the box. The instructions are easy to follow- you'll have it down after the first chair and not need them for the second. Once they're set, put them where you want and get sitting!<br /><br />There's not much else I can say aside from the fact that they're comfy. The backs have a bit of give so you can lean back a little, and they're very light, making transporting them a breeze. Cleaning them up is equally easy, them being plastic and all. My home has hardwood floors and there haven't been any scratches from the legs when they've been moved or bumped.<br /><br />I got a pair in black, mainly because I felt they'd look better over time with use. Both the white and red are good colors too, and it could be fun to get one set in each color. These things deserve the high review rating.
10571	__label2__	5	N	PC	B00HZR4EEE	OCZ Storage Solutions Vertex 460 Series 240GB SATA III 2.5-Inch 7mm Height Solid State Drive (SSD) With Acronis True Image HD Cloning Software- VTX460-25SAT3-240G	solid, fast mid-sized SSD	A thin, well-built drive. Great performance in a small package. The included 3.5" adapter bracket is handy for those upgrading desktops. Also included is a "I love my SSD" sticker.<br /><br />Write performance is outstanding. I overwrote the entire drive (zero-ed all blocks) 3x in a row without any performance degradation, despite using raw writes ("dd" in UNIX, so TRIM is not being invoked). The sustained 135MB/s recorded in my USB3 Plugable SATA dock is the fastest I've seen from that dock so far. The 7mm height of the drive is meant to fit ultrathin laptops, but makes the drive rattle in some external cases designed for thicker 2.5" drives. In those cases, a small piece of heat-safe foam (or other padding) helps keep the skinny drive in place.<br /><br />The "sweet spot" of SSD pricing continues to drop, but for the moment this size (200-300GB) is the best price vs capacity tradeoff. SSD adoption is still increasing and there's new models most every week, so today's top-rated item might be in the middle-of-the-pack in a few months. It's wise to check for newest reviews as well as compare the many different available models. Also, it now seems unnecessary to buy spinning drives any smaller than 300GB (maybe 500GB if you're not as price conscious).<br /><br />The OCZ name almost disappeared from SSD after the company's bankruptcy this past winter, but Toshiba bought the SSD division and this new drive shows they are serious about continuing the lineage.<br /><br />A fast, solid drive from an old name in flash products, now run by Toshiba. Recommended.

10580	__label2__	5	Y	Pet Products	B000795XMY	K&H Manufacturing Deluxe Kitty Sill With Bolster Tan Kitty Print 14-Inch by 24-Inch	Wonderful perch!	We recently adopted a cat wanted to start with a few items to make her comfortable.  Remembering how much the cats I had as a kid loved sitting in the window, this seemed like it would be a good fit.  When it arrived, my first impression was that it was easy to assemble and install, looked attractive, and seemed very comfortable.  Under the cover is a layer of egg-crate style foam with what seems to be a waterproof layer over that.  Then comes the actual cover and bolster.  The cover is soft and plush and the bolster is covered with a smooth fabric.  This all fits over a plastic frame.  While the frame doesn't feel overly heavy-duty, it does seem adequate.  Our cat is pretty small, only about six pounds, so I can't say how this would hold up to a 20 pound cat.<br /><br />There are two ways to install this.  You can use the enclosed screws and simply screw them into the window sill.  Slide the cover over and you're done.  This is what we did.  Also, there are two velcro strips, though I can't say how they would work.  I would imagine the tapes from Command hooks could be a possibility for damage-free installation, too.  The velcro (and Command tapes) need to sit for a time before you use the product.<br /><br />The bolster is always shown on the window side, which seems backward to me, but you can put the cover on with the bolster either side.  The bolster also zips off.  Our cat likes to sit on the perch, back away from the window against the bolster.  She seems quite comfortable, spends a lot of time there, and has made herself comfortable in her new home.  We are happy with our decision and would highly recommend this product.
10581	__label2__	4	N	Baby	B00PTL3TKI	Graco Contender 65 Convertible Car Seat, Chili Red	Compact, fair price, will last from infant to about 3 years old.	This car seat seems like a decent inexpensive solution for your child.    Pros:  - Small, can fit in the middle of a small sedan and still fit 2 adults at either side without much hassle.  - Easy to install... Some other car seats leave a lot to be desired.  - Will last from 5 to 40 pounds, which is about from birth till about 3 years of age. (obviously varies depending on child, this is just a rough estimate) This is for back facing carseat.  - Goes up to 65 pounds for forward facing.  - Buckles work fine. My other Graco had buckles "voluntarily recalled" this one has the newer styles already, so I don't foresee a recall. They are easy to adjust and to buckle  on or off.    Cons  - I have other Graco car seats, and the cushion/fabric seems like it's better quality than this. This was a small disappointment.    Overall, if you are looking for a first carseat, and got less than 150 to spend, this is a good choice.

This one won't break the bank, but it has a look of a far pricier watch than it actually is for those occasions.<br /><br />Better yet, it comes with 2 band colors both in leather: tan and black so you can easily match one's belt and shoes with accessorizing the watch for the evening or day as well.<br /><br />I personally prefer a watch with an all gold band if worn daily so that you don't have to wear out the band taking it on and off for showering or swimming, but for that occasional dressy outing, this works perfectly.<br /><br />The face being a skeleton of the watch creates a more stylish and interesting look for the piece of jewelry and quite frankly if you are a woman who loves a large watch, it can flow both ways just because of the beauty of the piece. The fancy box it comes in equals the look of the watch.<br /><br />That said, I have to agree with the other reviewer who mentioned it being difficult to read at times. I find the same problem and concur. The hands being small and the cut out making dark areas of the watch, they often blend in together and can cause reading the hand incorrectly.<br /><br />But for the value, it's not a constant problem and not one that would make one set aside the watch in favor of another in our opinion.

When it has came down to Citizen watches, they have been both a hit and a miss in regards to their value. They have had a huge hit with making classic and distinctive watches, and have a big miss when it has came down to catering to younger horologists with timepieces. Their Drive collection has honestly lagged in terms of design and distinction as well as quality for the long-term owner of a timepiece. This timepiece from Citizen, actually does more to confuse the owner than drive in regards to the overall value of the piece. It does have a lovely leather strap and significant movement, but that is really all there is to it. What I do not like about the watch is that you see the watch in 3 directions. The second display seems much bigger on the watch, while the regular time display, and the military display seem much smaller and weaker on the watch. Overall, it is a noble watch, but there are better ones Citizen has made overall for the money.<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: C+<br /><br />Overall: C

The interface is a little quirky; the multi-use buttons could have been better thought out:  The mode/select button is used a lot and I think would function better as a large round button on the front rather than the small push switch on the side - it would also be more comfortable for both right and left-handed users.  The sliding power side switch lies too flush with the case and the texture doesn’t make for an easy grip – you have to really press and push to move it.  I also don’t like that I can’t select Play directly after adjusting the volume. I have to select Stop first – that’s just bad design.  Selecting and deleting files is not as intuitive as I’d like, but the unit was recognized by Windows 7 easily and the folders can be accessed directly.  While the WAV file bit rate isn’t adequate for serious music recording, the recorder works fine as a scratch pad for saving instrumental or vocal ideas. Frankly it’s neither as full-featured nor useful as my Zoom H2 recorder but they’re at different price points and it’s not really fair to compare.  The MP3 Player mode comes with two “C-Pop” recordings of what sound like male and female Chinese vocalists singing English phonetically. The unit’s built-in speaker is not so useful, but the buds sound quite good. Of the seven EQ presets only 3-4 were noticeably distinct to my ears, including the Dynamic Bass Boost.  Overall it makes a compact little mp3 player with decent sound. But a better design and better recording capability would make it more competitive with other products in this range.

10594	__label2__	1	Y	Sports	B001IEKZDO	Omron Home Blood Pressure Kit Large, Blue/Black - 104MAJ	Don't expect this to last even a year.  They don't make replacement parts, so you'll have to buy another one soon.	Revised review (see original below)  I recommend you not buy this product because of the Omron planned obsolescence policy.  Within a year or so of purchase, the bladder and tubing failed.    I phoned Omron customer service to purchase replacement bladder and was told to buy a new unit.  This is not the first time one of these units lasted only a year or two for me even though used as directed.  Original review was as follows:  The cuff is really wide.  I'm 6'1&#34;, and it covers my upper arm.  Compared to my 15 year old lumiscope 13&#34; cuff, the readings are a little higher (not lower), but the arm to arm reproducibility is better.  I can't explain it, but although I think it's a little less sensitive, the ear sounds are louder.  Maybe less high frequency and louder bass.  I recommend this brand because the construction is sturdy (less good than the old lumiscope, but I can't find that).  Compared to other cuffs available from Amazon:  The $25 and under nylon bladder cuffs I have tried don't work at all.  My last cuff from amazon was made of cheap chinese rubber and decayed in two years (check that there is a long warrantee; this one had limited 1 year parts).  The Majestic has a latex bladder and I was hopeful enough after having spent a lot of time shopping for something like my lumiscope that I purchased a second as back-up.  The weak point of the unit may be the cords, and I suppose they are replaceable.  I haven't yet checked for replacement parts

10596	__label2__	5	Y	Home Improvement	B000HE7YQM	M-D Building Products 1025 All-Climate Auto and Marine 17-Feet Weather Seal Strip, Black	Highly versatile weather seal	Looking over these reviews you see a wide variety of applications for this versatile weather seal.  My two uses to date:    1.)  Insulation for the door of this humidor - [[ASIN:B005KLQURG Havana Cigar Cafe Display Humidor]].  I found that sponge rubber weatherstripping compressed too much in a short period of time and was not providing the necessary seal.  This rubber weather seal worked out perfectly for this application.    2.)  Bed rail fastener gasket - this is a much less conventional use for this product but it was effective for me.  My bed has a wooden head and foot board with wooden side rails that fasten to the foot/head boards with metal hardware.  With movement on the bed the friction of the side rails against the head/foot boards resulted in a distracting squeaking sound.  I used this rubber weather seal as a gasket where these pieces meet and it eliminated the noise.  In fact, I can't believe just how well it worked for this purpose and suggest you give it a try if you encounter this same annoyance.    I purchased this in September of 2014 and paid $6.99.  I'm very happy with the performance of this product.

It's almost certain that I will inadvertently leave it on from time to time, draining battery life.<br /><br />I borrowed my daughter's 10&#34; pad to see about the functionality, and we agreed that the tablet holding &#34;stretchy bands&#34; worked better than it initially appeared would be the case, and the weight of her pad nicely balanced the easel function.  Without a pad inserted, it had seemed far less stable.<br /><br />The case closes to a secure and thin unit that offers moderate protection.  Again, not bad.<br /><br />Writing this, I've already had keys stick a few times, creating text liiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiike this.<br /><br />The instant &#34;Tap Launch&#34; feature is a nicely considered one, as are the iconographic function keys at the top of the keyboard,but overall the KeyFolio is going to offer a mixed bag of helpful features and needless frustrations to the user.  i'd say wait for the next version of this model.

10600	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00M552Q0K	Michael Nyman: Make it Louder, Please! [Blu-ray]	Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself	Michael Nyman pays tribute to Handel in is own inimitable way PLUS a 50 minute documentary on Nyman himself<br /><br />For some reason, music stores and concert programs file British composer Michael Nyman under “Classical Music”. I find this interesting because that’s not really what Nyman’s music is about. First off, he is most well-known for the film score for “The Piano” and wrote film scores for some Peter Greenaway films. (So, is John Williams a “classical composer”?<br /><br />Next is the fact that most recordings of his music are by the Michael Nyman BAND (not Michael Nyman Orchestra!). And look at the instruments he uses: French horn, electric guitar, drum, and only two or three string players.  And most of his “pieces are short, lasting from two to 5 minutes.  Yes he does write repetitive rhythms like Phillip Glass but Nyman’s work is fast and he “borrows” tunes to insert in his pieces. While I like Phillip Glass and John Adams, I LOVE Nyman’s work.<br /><br />This wonderful Bluray disc contains the 2009 concert held in the German label Arthaus’s intimate concert hall. The occasion was the premiere of Nyman’s tribute to the work of Handel: I piece titled “Musicologist Scorse”. At 21:31 it is the only one of the 16 pieces in this 89 minute concert. The others are some of Nyman’s “hits” (but not “The Piano” and a few that are new (or were in 2010). The camera work is superb!  As a bonus – for those not familiar with the composer – is a 52-minute film “Michael Nyman – Composer in Progress” from 2009. This film has been available on another DVD from Arthaus, but it’s nice to have it here as a bonus.<br /><br />If you are a Nyman fan like me, you’ll want to see this BD. If you are new to Nyman and have a short attention span to instrumental works, this is a great start since you can watch the “portrait” first and then the concert.<br />The BD comes with a 20-page booklet of photos and an essay in English, French and German.<br /><br />I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />“Anything Phonographic”

10603	__label2__	3	N	Video Games	B006PP41Q8	PlayStation Vita Travel Pouch	Great if it's on sale.	Coming it at nearly twice the thickness of the PS Vita itself, Sony probably means "put it in your luggage" when they say "travel pouch". It's padded reasonably well for being transported in luggage, a laptop bag, etc., but I'm not sure I'd want it to be a standalone case.<br /><br />I hadn't seen this in person before ordering, so I was a little surprised by how soft the case is -- not only in feel, but construction. It just isn't going to stand up to too much.<br /><br />The interior divider does a great job of holding games, but isn't stitched all the way through, so there's some risk of hard objects one one side scratching the other side, if the divider shifts too much. Similarly, I definitely wouldn't want to use this for carrying around much more than a USB cable, cleaning cloth, and some games. Fitting the AC adapter and power cord in the pouch is possible, I guess, but I'd be really concerned about the plug scratching my Vita.<br /><br />Amazon usually has this for almost half off MSRP, which is a very nice deal. At full price though, I can't say I'd recommend this.

But they have never stopped letting go what made them a great watch company for over 100 years, class and diversity. That shows well in this luxurious diamond piece. It is easy to setup diamond-studed quartz piece, that sets up nicely and fits well around the wrist. It also is very easy to read and understand the time. The one thing I really didn't like about the piece is that it has both a 24 hr. subdial and a vertex with the A.M./P.M. indicator, where it could've shown the day of the week as well, where the hour glimpse is done once too much. But you firmly get a great watch for its money well, and I recommend this piece from Bulova for any man who wants the bling for their bucks.<br /><br />Price: B-<br /><br />Setup & Comfort: B<br /><br />Overall: B 1/2-

Providing a 30 day &#34;home retreat&#34; in the appendix, as well as an additional reading list, the book contains both practical advice and practical approach.  Wicks moves perspectives from psychology to spirituality in a way that doesn't quite mesh well, and as noted, the message gets a little redundant - which may belie both the simplicity and difficulty of the task at hand - namely the management and elimination of the head trash that holds us back from personal and professional growth.  The book is OK - but there are more interesting self-help type books out there.

I have had the one speaker version of these for about 6 months. It has held up well and worked great. I use it in a training room a work where there is no stereo. Hook it to my phone and it works great.<br /><br />This two speaker version is a bit louder than one speaker and as the room I use it in is around 25'x35' it does help a bit. It still won't fill the room with sound but it is an improvement. In a smaller room, like my office which is maybe 15'x 15' it can almost be to loud.<br /><br />even at full volume the sound is decent and there isn't a lot of crackling. Bass is of course lacking in comparison to a large system but that is to be expected. They do include a carrying case and the speakers themselves compress and lock to about half their size when not in use. They hold a charge for hours and charge quickly. the cord to charge and connect to a phone is included although no wall outlet adapter is.<br /><br />Overall these seem well made, are compact, have good sound, and if you need something you can use on the go they are great. Even if you just want a cheap bedroom solution ot use with a smartphone and pandora, etc....these a decent.

I almost gave this a 5 star review, but as much as I WANTED to, I just couldn't quite for one reason - the buttons.<br /><br />To give a bit of background, I have a great room that has only four recessed cans in the ceiling to light the whole room.  To along the peak of the ceiling, and two down one slope over the fireplace.  The controls for the two main ones are in a bank with the switches for the hallway and the kitchen, right in my traffic pattern.  The controls for the two on the other edge of the room are next to the fireplace, the exact opposite side of the room.  So those don't get used too often, despite how useful they can be sometimes.<br /><br />So lighting has been a real pain in here, especially as I bounced from one type of light to another trying to find something that worked well.  The main ones that are always on after sundown are LED's now, nice 6k units that brighten up the area I'm in just fine.  But often when my son and I are building Lego or Megablok sets, we need the other lights after sunset since the two main just don't provide enough light.  That's about the only time I usually turn on the others.<br /><br />I thought if I had a remote for them, I'd be more likely to use them when needed for other things.<br /><br />This is my third or fourth try to get some kind of wireless control for this location.  The others were just too bulky to fit within the &#34;standard&#34; box the builders used here for the wall switch.  This is the first that fit, and it didn't even have to be crammed in there.  It came with the three wire connectors to hook it up to the wires from the walls, and they were large enough to cover the stripped part of the copper on the existing wires, but not so large as to be too bulky to shove behind the box of the dimmer.<br /><br />The wall plate is two pices, the one piece with screws that screws to the actual switch hardware, then a plate that snaps into place over that, so this plate DOES stick out from the wall more than a standard wall plate does, noticeably more.  Installation took me all of 6 minutes from start to finish, including two trips to the basement to turn the circuit off and back on.<br /><br />The remote comes unsynchronized, so you have to sync it with the switch. Easy enough, hold OFF on the wall switch for 10 seconds or so, then do the same on the OFF switch on the remote.<br /><br />It works well.  I like the dimming up it does for the bulbs when turned on, and that it dims off as well, rather than just instant brightness or darkness.  The &#34;favorite&#34; raised button on the remote is handy if you have a preferred setting you want to use most of the time,  The remote is responsive and accurate - I've not had any misfires.<br /><br />Now the reason I took a star off - the buttons.  I really hate the feel of them.  There's a button centered in the undersized buttons, and they roll all around it, in all directions.  So it always feels like it's about to come loose or something.  They tilt all around that center pivot point if you hit one of the edges.  The other downside is that there is no &#34;favorite&#34; or &#34;last&#34; setting for the wall switch itself.  I had installed the MACL-153M-WH switch for my mom at her condo, and that's just the single button, feels better, and remembers a favorite setting from just the wall switch.  This one doesn't have the same functionality unfortunately.<br /><br />My other wishlist item would've been that it have an LED somewhere for easy finding in the dark.  But the LED's are only on if the light is on.  The whole &#34;raised icon&#34; to &#34;easily find in the dark&#34; really seems pretty useless to me - if you've already got your hands on the switch and can feel the raised icon, clearly you've ALREADY found the switch...<br /><br />Apparently the CFL's I had in the cans were not dimmable, since as soon as I turned this on, they just started blinking on and off.  This wouldn't even work with them as a simple on/off switch.  But that was good, it gave me the excuse to buy some better LED's, as these were the only cans left that I hadn't swapped to LED yet.<br /><br />But as I said, this is the first switch I've tried at home that fit my switch box in the wall.  It works very well, despite my lack of enthusiasm for the buttons.

It is 15-feet by 5/8 inches. The hose is reinforced and comes with standard brass couplings. The couplings made good connections and do not leak even without Teflon tape.<br /><br />The hose came tightly wrapped which caused some kinks in the hose - I highlighted two of them in the attached photo.

He got down to about 1 minute to clear it out after a few days.  Though, he got through it quick, he loved it. He got very excited every time he saw it. I say loved because in 3 weeks it is destroyed.<br /><br />I like how it made him work and think, but I am taking a star off because this isn't a very durable item, for a big puppy!

First thing to drive a person crazy would be the false alarms, that are caused by the dying battery that was sent with it.  Change the battery, and all is well!  Has to be mounted really close to bottom of door, because the bottom door gasket keeps the door off the floor some distance already.  Distance wise, my furthest door is about 45-50 feet away; works fine and happy. Detached garage.

10631	__label2__	3	N	Lawn and Garden	B006DX16PQ	Nooski 300000798 Mouse Trap With 10 Rings	Not Sure About This	If you have a house and you live near woods, you're going to have a rodent problem. My rule is that they can have the outdoors, but they cannot come indoors, and that includes the crawlspace and attic.<br /><br />Still, even when they refuse to follow my rule I get no enjoyment out of killing anything. I've been using traps, but this one intrigued me enough to check it out. Is it a better mousetrap? Despite claims that it's more humane, I have real doubts about how quickly the mechanism kills.<br /><br />Ultimately it's up to the individual about how comfortable they are with a particular means of extermination. I'm just not comfortable with this one.
10632	__label2__	4	N	Books	1594204365	Year Zero: A History of 1945 (Ala Notable Books for Adults)	To begin again	1945 is year zero, the year in which the real battle for peace began in many ways. Ian Buruma sets out to write a history of that year; but more than that - he examines the aftermath of the war. Little known facts and incidents populate this book, even if one has been a frequent reader of this time period's history. At points a reader can be caught off guard by some of the comparisons. The celebration of VE Day is compared to Beatle mania. The structure of his writing can also be confusing in places. He writes about Germany and then in the next sentence of Japan, without a comparison or a break in the organization.<br /><br />Much of the study is not so much about the rebuilding after the war, but the horrors still inflicted on the people that survived and their fight to survive the peace. Even rations were cut in Britain after the armistice. The retributions of soldiers and civilians, the rejection of soldiers returning by friends and relatives are examined. We learn of graves opened in the search for valuables and gold teeth, and dead crows for sale for food. This is not really the reconstruction, but the roadblocks that came after the war.<br /><br />This is a hard read, to know of the killings and revenge that fill its pages. It is, in many places a tough view of human behavior; but we also see the very hard attempts to bring the shattered countries and people back to a semblance of normal life. There is an outstanding analysis of the British electorates' rejection of Churchill.<br /><br />Still, even with the choppiness in some of the writing and of various sentence structures; this is still a must read for those who wish to learn of the time after WWII and the attempt to make peace, despite the terrors many faced. Those interested in history would do well to put this on their reading list.

I purchased 2 of the battery powered Gillettes so found this &#34;manual&#34; razor a bit surprising.  But having not need to worry about batteries makes it all the more convenient.  Functions well so far, and as the commercials have portrayed, I'm sure we've all contorted our faces to get here and there....though I still do, that might be from habit.
10634	__label2__	1	Y	Home Entertainment	B005MR6CNK	Sony SMP-N200 Streaming Media Player with Wi-Fi	No Subtitle Support	I read some of the reviews and decided that this is the streaming player for which I have been searching. I bought it and set it up with no problem. However, to fully enjoy a movie I need subtitles. This player, to my utmost surprise, does not support subtitles. I cannot use it and that is the reason for my one star rating.<br /><br />If you are interested in this item I suggest you read the review by Jean Luc, which I unfortunately failed to do prior to the purchase. This is the most comprehensive and informative review I have seen. It will be a majorr aid in your decision as to making the purchase. This review lists the numerous pros and cons and if I had read it I would not have purchased this item because lack of subtitle/CC support is identified. If you don''t need subtitles then this may be the player for you. One big plus is that it does not require a credit card to start off with such as the Roku 2 XS 1080P does. I tried the Roku and it was so bad I had to send it back. I wil keep the Sony in hopes that a subtitle upgrade is in the future. Wishful thinking, I know.

Universal fit most Headphone models; Grado SR SRi-series, Sennheiser HD-series, Beyerdynamic and more.	Great looks and fit; as durable as the original	Got this to replace the aging headband on my [[ASIN:B0006NL5SM Beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO, 250 ohms]]. It does this just fine, in good style comparable to the original.  Pros: * Look is very similar to the original (one more snap, same color) * Fit is a tiny bit tight, but it does go on OK * Length is perfect * The cushioning is nice; I don't feel the headphones' weight up there at all  Cons: * The material feels delicate, like it'll probably wear out faster than the original; time will tell * The underside material (what contacts the metal band) is not nearly as durable as the material in the original, which is quite tough. This may never become an issue, but given how the DT 770's adjustment never stays put, this could manifest in some internal tears.  Other thoughts: * For the price, a nice replacement headband. I'll update periodically as it ages to note how it has performed. So far so good.  Followup: Nine months in, and I'm upping to 5-star because it's lasting, taking normal use and minor abuse like falling prey to cat shenanigans. No rips and tears, still soft.  Followup -- Oct 2015: still going strong, no tears, no snags. I am impressed and have amended my earlier concerns about not being heavy-duty. It has taken daily use for quite a while, and hasn't shredded.

The toner cartridge I received was an "Office Depot" brand reconditioned toner cartridge and not anything connected to HP as the manufacturer.<br /><br />If I wanted a refilled used laser toner cartridge I would have bought one and at a much lower cost than this one is selling at - hence my surprise to see I was sent a refilled cartridge.

They are nice quality especially for the low price, and look beautiful on.  They're just the right small size for everyday and I find that they're ideal when I am wearing an attention-getting necklace or bracelet as they don't steal the spotlight at all.  I haven't had any problems at all with the backs falling off of mine, and they feel secure - so it seems possible that this has been improved since previous reviews were written.  I am very pleased with these earrings and would definitely repeat this purchase.

The directions also say you must wash your hands after use so I am sure the cleaner must have a lot of strong chemicals. I prefer using milder cleaners. On the other hand, the main reason I bought this item is that I was hoping it was refillable, and it is!

You'd think after the Halloween 4 mess in the expensive Halloween boxed set, they would get it right in the Nightbreed boxed set, which us UBER expensive if you consider it's only 3 discs of ONE movie.<br /><br />I purposely went for the boxed set to get both the director's cut AND the theatrical cut on Blu-ray so I could upgrade my theatrical from the DVD. But when I watched the Blu-ray of the theatrical cut, instead of the 5.1 audio track that was promised on the back of the box, I could only get a 2-channel stereo track. Knowing my DVD of the movie has a 5.1 track, I figured maybe there was a problem with my Blu-ray. So I posted my issue on the Scream Factory facebook page, and they were kind enough to respond to the post:<br /><br />Sorry but there is not a 5.1 track on the theatrical cut on all discs. We discovered the misprint that it include it after the wrap had printed.<br /><br />The misprint shouldn't even be considered the problem. They couldn't include the 5.1 audio mix that already exists since it was on the DVD??? So much for Blu-ray giving you the ultimate movie experience. As much as I appreciate all the work Scream Factory does bringing rare films or cuts of films to Blu-ray, it really disappoints when it doesn't deliver on the easiest part--giving the best possible features when they are already available elsewhere!

Sure, the busy bars entertained my maltese and poodle mix, but not this toy in the beginning.  I gave this toy one last chance to be useful.. and then I finally found out how to use this toy to dispense treats! My dogs love beef liver cubes. I cut the cubes into tiny pieces, small enough to fit down the tube of this toy. Then, I used the Pupperoni treats to plug up the small holes on the sides, and a really big piece of Pupperoni or a beef liver cube to plug up the large end of the tube. With this formula, this toy is now a success! It exhausts and challenges the dogs! It usually takes them quite a while to get all the treats out. Hooray! :) Yeah, if I didn't figure out this technique sooner, then I would have tossed this toy for sure.  So far, this toy has been very durable. Its lasted longer than our tire-based toys.

It's so much easier with the software.<br /><br />My only very minor complaint is they should have blank templates.

I purchased these locks to keep my 2 year old out of our cabinets. They were almost impossible to install. It must be my cabinets or something but it took forever. I had to lay inside the cabinets and move things a millimeter this way and that until they finally started locking. I also needed to fold some small pieces of paper on the underside of the front of the locks in order for them to stick out enough to catch. It took me about 2 hours to get 4 locks in place. Now that they're installed they work great. They keep the cabinets completely closed. You can't even get a finger in there. To open them you just put the magnet on the door and that's it. Simple design and they work great. They're pretty strong as well. I could probably pull pretty hard and break them but there's no way my toddler could.

Excellent size, handy soap/lotion dispenser by OXO. As usual, OXO has designed a helpful product. I wanted to put together my own hand soap, using olive oil and aloe vera, plus lemon and a little antibacterial soap. It was easy to do with this dispenser, because it has a very wide opening which made it easy to pour in the contents. It was easy to rinse out, and very simple to use. Now I'm enjoying my own hand soap, playing around with the thickness until I get it just right. I'll probably end up buying a huge bottle of my favorite lemon hand soap as soon as I get tired of experimenting. Either way will work fine in this dispenser.

10660	__label2__	5	N	Musical Instruments	B00DZW1CDO	Ernie Ball MVP, Most Valuable Pedal	Very Well Made / More Expressive Options Than a Fixed Sweep Pedal	There are a number of models in Ernie Ball’s pedal series with different features and Amazon will often combine reviews, which (IMO) can be confusing.  To be clear, I’m talking about the MVP 6162 – the straight mono volume pedal plus a tuner jack. There’s no stereo pan functionality and, although the instruction sheet doesn’t specify, based on performance it’s a good bet the pedal uses a 250k audio-taper pot similar to the 6166 and 6180 models – best suited for passive guitar and bass pickups.  I don't usually comment on other reviews but incorrect info shouldn't go unchallenged when it can mislead people. Anyone who says this pedal won't fully cut off volume is wrong or isn’t using it correctly: There are minimum and maximum sweep knobs and turning the minimum knob fully counter-clockwise gives you a heel position that fully cuts off volume (or as fully as turning down the volume pot on your instrument will – I’m not talking scientific detection of incidental line noise/interference here - just practical 'off').  The minimum knob also allows you to set the lower volume ‘floor’ – meaning if you don’t want to fully cut off volume you can maintain some level at the pedal’s full-heel position.  Why might you want to do this? Consistency for one: In a dynamic playing context, you may not have time to tweak the pedal position just so. Quickly going full-heel, confident you’re at the level you want,  can be a real convenience (and your sound person/recording engineer will thank you – even if it’s yourself).  At the other end the maximum knob is somewhat more intuitive:  it allows you to set the toe-full-down maximum volume. By experimenting with min and max settings you can vary the sweep from heel to toe along with the absolute floor and ceiling volume. If you’ve only used a volume pedal with a single fixed sweep – and you wished for either a ‘tighter’ or more-gradual swell, the MVP will provide some useful and possibly more expressive and comfortable options.  In case you’re wondering, turning both the max and min knobs fully down does not give you an ‘anti-volume’ pedal with zero sound, it sets a fairly wide sweep from full off to a relatively low-level maximum.  I got the MVP to replace my trusty-but-scratchy 40+ year-old DeArmond pedal I've had since I discovered as a kid in the 70's that Steve Howe used one. I'm a lefty and lefty instruments were rare and pricey so I converted my own guitars, leaving the knobs on the right-hand side. Because of that I could never manage that Roy Buchanan pinky-twist move with the volume pot and needed a pedal to get 'violin' tones and textures (the EBow was still a couple of years away).  Speaking of comfort, the MVP toe-down position lies parallel to the floor while the DeArmond has a 15-20 degree angle that I always found easy on my ankle – especially if I’m doing a lot of fast movements. It wouldn’t be hard to devise a large wooden shim for the MVP if you feel the same way.  The MVP pedal action is much tighter compared to the DeArmond and I prefer  that because it makes fine control easier (no doubt decades of use have loosened up the DeArmond but even in its prime I remember wishing it were a little stiffer). One thing the DeArmond has that the MVP doesn’t is a side-to-side tone pot function – granted it’s cheesy and will cost you even more in tone than the volume pot itself does, but it’s there. Speaking of impact on pure signal, I couldn’t detect much loss with the MVP – although as always, the longer your cables the more potential degradation.  The MVP’s 3/16” brushed aluminum casing is rugged, has nice mass to sit tight without being excessively heavy, and looks great. The flat, rubberized foot surface has nice ‘tooth’ to it that’s comfortable to use wearing shoes or not.  The min/max knobs are heavy metal (no pun intended) and have solid turn ratios.  I wish the battery door were metal rather than plastic but I like that it’s hinged otherwise it would just scream ‘lose me!’. The battery sits close to the surface and is easy to fish in and out. The review pedal didn’t come with a power supply but I prefer batteries when recording - power supplies can add noise especially at low levels.  If I were back in my club-gig days, tossing equipment in and out of dark trunks, I might question the open access to the pedal’s internal components under the foot control – too easy to get picks and other small items stuck in there and it could be a pain to shake them out.  I can’t comment on the tuner jack function (I’m old school tuning fork and ears).  Bottom Line: The MVP makes for a more flexible-functioning and quieter volume pedal than traditional fixed sweep pedals.  And in this age of ever-thinner plastics the top-notch workmanship is much appreciated.  I’ll still keep my DeArmond for sentimental reasons but the MVP will surely be my go-to volume pedal from now on.

Look closely and you'll spot some cool Mickey paraphernalia in some levels.<br /><br />Using old cartoon strips as settings for the 2-D levels is ingenious. It's too bad they don't go on longer and only serve as transitional levels.<br /><br />There is some replay value. There are a lot of pins, which might interest players who like collecting Disney pins in real life. More interesting are the unlockable cartoon reels and concept art.<br /><br />THE BAD<br /><br />The gameplay. It just isn't that exciting. It seems the game was torn between appealing to kids and holding the interests of adult gamers. Epic Mickey was billed as a platformer, but the never reaches anything as exciting as the Mario games. There's some jumping, there are some decent moments, but it's mostly just fetch quests where you have to find an item for somebody. However, the fetch quests often seem forced as they come at random times from people who aren't well developed characters (there are exceptions - I liked Horace the Detective).<br /><br />Other reviewers have criticized the camera system and I do agree. It's not a deal breaker, but there are times when it refuses to give you a clear view of what you need to see.<br /><br />THE UGLY<br /><br />The game is too hard for kids, too easy for adults. I think this game would have benefitted greatly from allowing the user to adjust the difficult setting.<br /><br />THE FINAL WORD<br /><br />At the end of the day, there's a lot of potential in Epic Mickey,but I can't really say it's a great game. It's probably one of the better third-party games for the Wii, but that's not saying a whole lot. I will probably try Epic Mickey 2 because Warren Specter seems aware of Epic Mickey's flaws, but I won't be rushing to get it on Day One.
10665	__label2__	5	N	Video DVD	B00D2D1WVI	Jesse Stone: The Complete Set	Soulful Detective Series	If you like a detective series with a soul, this Jesse Stone series offers it up in the form of haunting and original music, inspired scenery and sets (love Stone's waterside home), quirky and realistic plots, insightful casting, gorgeous cinematography, and a sensitive but tough detective with Tom Selleck playing Jesse Stone.<br /><br />Jesse has a few of his own mysteries to solve, along with the ones he confronts in his work.  Is he ever going to not answer the phone when his ex-wife calls and just forget about her?  Will he be able to stop drinking?  Can he keep his community happy in the small northeastern town he polices and hang onto his job?  Will he ever find a woman who is sympatico?<br /><br />In between battling his own demons, therapy sessions with his shrink (William Devane), and cryptic conversations with just about everybody including his dog, Jesse manages to solve quite a few crimes with his non-police manual methods.<br /><br />In analyzing why this series is compelling, one reason is that it just feels real.  Selleck inhabits the role of Jesse Stone with ease.  You feel like he's playing some aspect of himself.  The secondary characters are strong.  You don't feel like you are watching a show.  You feel like it's real life.  And you care about the characters.  Even the crooks have a sort of likability in some instances.<br /><br />This is the kind of series you could watch every year.  Although another show hasn't been purchased by CBS, Selleck said in an interview that he thinks someone will want to produce another episode.  We hope Selleck is right. In the meantime, you can just re-watch the episodes in this complete set until they do.
10666	__label2__	5	N	Books	1423184629	Far From You	Great book for fans of Veronica Mars.	Sophie Winters is a drug addict. Everyone knows that, but no one will believe that she's been clean for over six months, ever since her parents sent her to her aunt's for a tough love DIY rehab. But no matter what she says, no one believes the OXY pills--- the pills they found in her coat the night she and her best friend Mina walked into the woods together and only Sophie made it out alive --- aren’t hers. With everyone from her parents to Mina's brother believing that Mina was shot at a drug deal gone bad, it's up to Sophie to find the real motive and the real killer.<br /><br />But as she solves the case, Sophie has other issues to deal with, like the combined grief of her best friend's death and the knowledge that though they were both in love, Mina would have never agreed to be with her openly. Complicating things is her attraction to Mina's brother, who has always loved her and is responsible for the car accident that left her in permanent pain and led to her pill addiction. Joining forces with the strange but kind home-school kid who found her and Mina, Mina's ex-boyfriend and Mina's brother, Sophie begins to uncover the cold case that will lead her to solve two town murders.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is one part murder mystery, one part painful love story. Told in chapters that alternate between the present and the three most important times of her life --- the car crash, her pill addiction, and Mina's shooting --- it leaves plenty of mysteries unsolved until the final chapters. Sharpe does a great job as painting Sophie's love for Mina as another kind of addiction, an ever-present force in her life she could never really be free of, even as it was hurting her.<br /><br />FAR FROM YOU is a great book for fans of Veronica Mars, yet easily sets itself apart from the trend of YA murder mysteries with its unique love triangle and authentic voice of a teen dealing with addiction.<br /><br />Reviewed by Molly Horan on April 9, 2014.

I did have some basic expectations of this one.<br />It feels REALLY cheap, all around. First time I sat on it I was really unhappy. Guess I am spoiled by memory foam :-(. It looks as cheap as it feels. And why would I get BROWN legs with a gray couch?<br />I would have NEVER purchased this couch, at any price, had I seen it in a show room.....<br />Stuck with it now, at least until it falls apart...that shouldn't be too long from now as I have dogs.
10669	__label2__	2	Y	Books	1934554499	Large Family Logistics	Not For Me	I was expecting to like this book much more than I did. There was some practical stuff in the book, but not as much as I would have hoped. This book presents the husband as the authority in the house. In all areas. At all time. Kitchen needs to be remodeled? Husband decides how. Kids need new homeschool curriculum? Ask Dad what he want them to learn. It isn't presented as keeping the husband involved in the goings on of the family or weighing his opinions with yours, it always comes across as you ask him what he wants and then you make it happen. I don't view my role of wife and mother in that way. That is not what submission says to me. That sounds an awful more like slavery than submission. (All the responsibility with zero authority.) It was very hard for me to get passed this aspect of the book. Even when I tried to overlook it, I'd come across her advice that was really more of a personal preference than actual wisdom. She prefers jumpers. (As in those overall type dresses that were popular in the early 90s.) I can get just as much mothering done in my jeans and t-shirt, thank you very much. That is a personal preference. There is nothing holy or even helpful about jumpers. There was plenty of this type of thing sprinkled throughout the book. I was also a bit surprised that the publishers chose the textbook style of printing. It just didn't seem to be a textbook style book of any kind, so the choice of printing was strange to me.<br /><br />Overall, I don't recommend the book.

10670	__label2__	5	Y	Home Entertainment	B00F5NB7JK	Roku 1 Streaming Media Player (2710R)	Love this little black box	We've had our Roku over a year now and are quite satisfied with it.  We had a little trouble getting it installed as we have a Samsung tv and they seem to have their own set of instructions and my husband and I are not the brightest on computer gibberish instructions.  But once installed, all is good.  We can now get Netflix which always has something to watch and  of course Amazon Prime has a lot of different shows to watch.  There are several avenues to sign up for that have even more variety but they do come with an additional fee, as does Netflix.  One CAN get too much variety and get addicted to just sitting like lumps of lard on a cold plate and not accomplishing anything at all!<br /><br />It's funny that we now watch several tv series that my husband had made snap judgements on when they first appeared on tv and said they wouldn't be any good and wouldn't watch them, but now thinks they're just great and watches 3 and 4 episodes at a time.  Such as Blacklist. Men can sometimes be so frustrating.  I could just pinch his head off at times!<br /><br />The little remote that comes with Roku is very easy to operate and the actual receiver box that attaches to the tv is very small and unobtrusive.  I don't think anyone could go wrong with the Roku 2710R.

They contain a &#34;fluoropolymer&#34; similar to, if not the same as, &#34;Teflon&#34; which is a trademarked brand name.I shoot a lot. It works well and does seem to impregnate into the surface of the metal hopefully providing protection and lubrication in the event you get caught without lube. Other than that I can't say it works any better than any other quality lube for day to day operation. I am still using it, though, so I must be liking it some.
10675	__label2__	2	N	Video DVD	B00AEFYQE2	No Strings Attached	Not funny, without any romantism included, wasting two good actors, this is almost the "level zero" of romantic comedies	I didn't like this film at all and count it as one of my most disappointing viewings ever - and that came as an unpleasant surprise, considering the names of actors and the director. Below, more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.<br /><br />Emma (Natalie Portman) and Adam (Ashton Kutcher) unwillingly keep running into each other - until one day they get really close... Emma however is reluctant to the very idea of a relationship and asks for a &#34;sex only - no strings attached&#34; common operation. Adam, who is much less cynical, agrees after some hesitation (and we can totally understand him - after all, this is Natalie Portman who asks, for God's sake...). Of course, things will not go as smoothly as it is supposed.<br /><br />The general idea wasn't the easiest thing in the world to be handled, I must give that to the director. But Ivan Reitman, even if he didn't make a really good film since &#34;Ghostbusters&#34; in 1984, is an experienced veteran and he could definitely do better than that.<br /><br />The scenario is weak and the potential of both main actors is wasted. There is a couple of jokes, but they mostly turn around Adam's dad, an aging playboy played by Kevin Kline. For the most of time this film is definitely NOT funny - and that is rarely good news for a comedy. As for the romance, well, there is hardly any - I saw more romantism in some butcher shops...<br /><br />I give this film two stars only because I generally like Ashton Kutcher (I found him particularly good in &#34;Butterfly Effect&#34;, &#34;The Guardian&#34;, &#34;My boss's daughter&#34; and &#34;A lot like love&#34;) and of course I would watch Natalie Portman in ANYTHING... But this not-funny, not-romantic, occasionally vulgar film was for me a TERRRRIBLE DISAPPOINTMENT, nowhere near the quality of &#34;Notting Hill&#34;, &#34;While you were sleeping&#34;, &#34;When Harry meets Sally&#34; or &#34;Must love dogs&#34; - gosh, it wasn't even anywhere near the level of &#34;A lot like love&#34; (a lesser, albeit honest film). I am glad that I rented it instead of buying. AVOID!

Since R2D2 is shorter than the figures of Luke Skywalker and others (which &#34;are&#34; 6 inches tall) the R2D2 has to be half their height to be proportional...Make sense???

10679	__label2__	4	N	Books	1878424076	Seth Speaks: The Eternal Validity of the Soul	Can anyone please check the dog pound?	Together with "The Seth Material", "Seth speaks" is the most well-known book featuring Seth starring himself. Apparently, this book pretty much started the New Age channelling craze. Seth is a multi-dimensional, spiritual personality from another plane of existence, who periodically speaks through the mouth of medium Jane Roberts (whom he calls Ruburt).<br /><br />Now, that sentence should really be in the past tense, since Roberts is deceased, but Seth claims that time doesn't really exist, so I might as well speak in the present tense, wouldn't you agree?<br /><br />I tend to avoid channelled material, but the few items I somehow managed to sift through were quite different from "Seth speaks". This book blends incredibly dense, pseudo-philosophical and boring prose with a strange and much welcome sense of humour. In general, the channelled spirits seem to take themselves far too seriously! Seth makes slips of the tongue (at one point forgetting the number of chapters he has dictated), has a love-hate relationship with cats, claims to have lost his dog somewhere on our planet, and seems fond of beer! He also insists on starting every other sentence with the words "Now". At one point he jokingly refers to himself as a ghostwriter...<br /><br />As for Seth's message, it's another version of New Age thinking - I sometimes wonder how many versions there might be out there?<br /><br />God isn't a person, but an ever-evolving Consciousness, referred to by Seth as All That Is. Time as we know it doesn't exist. An almost infinite number of alternate realities co-exist simultaneously. (In some parallel universe, Seth's dog presumably wasn't taken by the dog-catcher.) Strictly speaking, reincarnation therefore doesn't exist either, since all our "previous lives" exist at the same time. We are all multi-dimensional personalities, living on many different planes of existence, constantly evolving in innumerable directions. We are also somehow part of God, who is the ultimate multi-dimensional entity. Weirdly for a system that lacks time, All That Is nevertheless evolves and constantly creates new forms. This is, of course, impossible for us puny mortals to comprehend. Everything that happens to us is created by ourselves. Our consciousness creates our reality, whether good, bad or ugly. Our material world with all its suffering is a mass hallucination. We should all learn and evolve.<br /><br />Since everything is an illusion suspended in a timeless Now (pun intended), it's difficult to see the point of the exercise. How can you learn and evolve within an illusion where everything exists simultaneously? At various points in "Seth speaks", our friend tends to mellow his message somewhat. I have already pointed out that All That Is apparently evolves despite there not being any time, and it would seem that our existence in some sense isn't completely illusory, after all. As for suffering and evil, Seth concedes that suffering doesn't necessarily have to exist, that we suffer due to our unevolved state, and that the point of suffering is to teach us to overcome suffering - a somewhat softer view than that taken by, say, Dolores Cannon (see my previous review on this plane of existence). Still, when it comes to the philosophical points about time, space, matter and consciousness, I would say that a few books by David Ray Griffin might do Seth some good...<br /><br />Seth also says a few scandalous things about Jesus. Is anyone surprised? Apparently, Jesus was part of a broader personality incarnating as three distinct human beings: John the Baptist, Jesus and Paul. In 2075, Paul will return. This is tantamount to the Second Coming. Seth is unsure about the crucifixion. At one point, he seems to be suggesting that the entire Gospel stories are dramas and dreams, "real" on a psychic level but not in any material-historical sense. At another point, he spins a scenario similar to the Muslim one, only more weird. (Of course, the Muslim traditionsabout Jesus are in themselves warped versions of the Gnostic "laughing saviour".) Apparently, Jesus got away. Judas deliberately "betrayed" the wrong man to the authorities, a poor deluded crackpot who thought he was the Christ and absolutely wanted to be crucified. In drugged condition, this substitute was indeed executed by the Romans. His body was stolen by some of the disciples in the dead of night (hence the empty tomb). The real Jesus then appeared to the disciples, who therefore believed he had been resurrected. In reality, he was still alive and well in his physical body. Ah, what evangelical heresy-hunters could do with this!<br /><br />Does Seth really exist? At one point, our ghostwriter comes close to conceding that he doesn't: "This voice is only used as a symbol of the energy and the strength that is available to each of you, as you utilize those abilities that are your heritage". A similarity to other channelled material is the amount of historical references which makes no sense. Seth believes in Atlantis. He expounds at length on an underground civilization called Lumania, whose inhabitants were so fearful and shy that they made up the fierce warrior god Jehovah as a protector. Seth claims to have been a certain 4th century pope, but no such pope is recorded by history. More damningly, Seth claims that a Muslim Arab he once met wavered between faith in Allah and faith in Moses - an absurd proposition. Presumably, Seth or Ruburt have mixed up Allah with Muhammad! But even that is absurd, since Muslims recognize Moses as a prophet. Somebody should send Seth a book by Huston Smith on comparative religion, c/o Lumania.<br /><br />Part of my own multi-dimensional personage wants to believe that Seth is a real being and even help him find that poor dog of his (probably a Newfie). The other part feels that Seth is simply a part of Jane Roberts' earthly personality. He doesn't say anything that's *really* out of the ordinary compared to what every other Theosophist, kabbalist or esotericist has already said - except those parts that can be checked and disproved. But then, I suppose followers of Seth could claim that their beloved entity really did get some things completely wrong. In contrast to many other purported spirit guides, Seth is strangely unassuming.<br /><br />Despite the humour, I can't say "Seth speaks" is an easy read. It's repetitive, long-winding and often really boring. But yes, it could be of some interest to scholars of comparative religion or new agey seekers. One sure wonders how the contemporary spiritual scene would have looked like, had more entities like Seth been channelled by the Neo-Theosophical faithful? Imagine a conversation between Seth and Osho!<br /><br />Now, I'm not sure how to rate "Seth speaks", but finally I decided to play it nice and give our dog-loving, beer-sipping and vaguely Islamophobic ghostwriter three and a half stars.

10690	__label2__	4	N	Sports	B00PUHQXRM	SPRI Pro-Tech Treadmill Equipment Mat, 96 x 36-Inch x 3mm	Very high quality and heavy duty - do not expect cushioning	This is a very strong heavy duty mat - but it gives virtually zero cushioning.  It is really indestructible.  Perfect if you want to put it on hardwood floors or anything worth protecting.  You won't have any indentations from equipment.<br /><br />This should not be confused with a yoga mat or anything similar.  It is much more of a hard plastic than any type of foam.<br /><br />It is also incredibly heavy (as far as weight).  This probably weighs around 20 pounds.

10697	__label2__	5	Y	Watches	B000SZPZV6	Timex Kids T79051 My First Timex Outdoors Watch with Black Fast Wrap Velcro Strap	A Grandson's Joy	My first "real" wristwatch from Mom and Dad back in the late 1950' was a Timex about this size with a chrome expansion bracelet.  I wore it proudly for years and just couldn't get enough of the "chrome plated" stainless steel bling on my wrist.  It was tough and durable until after about 4 yrs my body acids began to make it corrode.<br /><br />When I saw this one, couldn't resist getting it for my precious 8 yr old Grandson.  And he loves it as much as I did mine.  Keeps accurate time and provides him with that little bit of "waterproof" assurance he was wanting so he could play outdoors without having to take it off everytime he went out.  Fit's a child's arm nicely and the velcro'd strap is a great convenience for a stop and go youngster!  Yo Timex!

10699	__label2__	3	N	Camera	B00AR95FPO	Sony HDR-PJ380/B High Definition Handycam Camcorder with 3.0-Inch LCD (Black) (Discontinued by Manufacturer)	Teeny Tiny Mess	The Sony HDR-PJ380 is a miniscule, light weight video camera with a built in projector that frustrates me. On the bright side, the video quality is good, the zoom range is impressive (from really wide angle to stalker telephoto) and the recorded sound is excellent. On the dim side, the camera is an ergonomic mess, the projector is weak, the lens quality is sad.<br /><br />December 6, 2014 Update: In the two years I have owned this camera, it has proven to be exactly what I thought from the beginning. I used the projector maybe 4 times and that was just to make people laugh. It is frankly a worthless attachment on the camera. The clip to hold the battery in has broken. That attachment point is a really cheap piece of plastic. The only reason I continued to use the camera is the wide angle lens. I used to shoot volleyball matches in tight areas. The wide angle was a major benefit. This camera is a teeny tiny mess.<br /><br />This is one of those video cameras that seem like a great idea; include a pico projector so people can watch videos right away, no television needed. In practice, it doesn't work out quite that well. The projector is really dim, the room has to be pretty darn dark to see the video and it has to be projected onto a white wall. The sound from the camera is just barely useful (I still can't find the volume control). This camera is capable of really good HD video, projected the video looks sad.<br /><br />My biggest complaint with this camera is the ergonomics, how does this thing feel in my hand and how easy is it to use. I could never find a way to grip the camera with my right hand so that I could work the record button and the zoom button. My hand was always twisted around in an uncomfortable position and I couldn't hold the camera steady. Using my left hand on the screen wasn't a whole lot of help either. I do have big hands. The strap cannot be removed. I could get it to just barely fit my hand.<br /><br />There is this ridiculous USB cable built into the camera with no way to remove that useless piece of computer connection. The thing is poked into a slot in the camera grip. Personally, this is just extra weight to carry around. The pigtail is short, plugging into a laptop might work, but forget a desktop computer. The box does include a USB extension cord (but hey, I have to carry that around to use the camera, why not just make the cable detachable like every other camera manufacturer).<br /><br />The camera has a power switch located behind the flip out touchscreen, which has to be the single dumbest place to put a power button. When the video screen is flipped open, the camera turns on. In order to use the power button, the video screen has to be flipped open - turning on the camera. The other two buttons behind the video screen are a play button which switches the camera into playback mode and back to shooting mode; and a projector button that turns the projector off and on. Once the projector is on, the touchscreen no longer works. Menus and video selection has to be done with the Zoom lever and the photo button. This was a combination that I couldn't master, it was almost impossible to use. The even worst part of this whole mess - whatever memory was selected in the Setup menu, is the memory used for playback and projection. What a pain in the rear to switch between the internal memory and an SD card.<br /><br />Along with the three oddly placed buttons, there is a miniHDMI input and output port. The box contains a miniHDMI to standard HDMI cable. There is also a 3.5mm jack for a microphone or &#34;plug in power&#34; (whatever that means).<br /><br />There is a tiny flip door on the side of the camera for some kind of multifunction connector (no cable was included for that) and the AC adapter to charge the camera. The bottom of the camera has a trap door at the rear for an SD card and the tripod socket is in the center of the camera. If a tripod quick change plate is mounted on this camera, it is highly likely that the SD slot will be covered. Oddly, the battery release can be moved from either underneath the camera or from the side behind the video screen door. This is another mixed blessing - if I have the camera mounted on a tripod, I can open up the video door, turning on the camera, and then slide the battery release to remove the battery, turning off the camera.<br /><br />The disaster is that all the buttons on the camera are virtual; meaning everything to control this camera is on the touchscreen. That would be OK if there was some logic to the menus and buttons on the screen. This is the biggest mess of menus I have ever seen. The menus are: Shooting Mode, Camera/Mic, Image Quality/Size, Playback Function, Edit/Copy, and Setup. The Setup submenu is about 50 selections all in some odd groupings that are accessed by scrolling down (not swiping like in an iPhone, but touching an arrow to make the menu roll down one page). Finding the settings I need is the most frustrating complicated thing I have ever seen.<br /><br />The lens on this camera is not good. Outside chromatic aberration was bad (this is blue fringing around white objects against a dark background). The 55X end of the video is so soft, it is just barely useable. I have a sense that there is some kind of digital enhancement for the far end of the telephoto because the image goes very soft. Oddly, there is a setting to go even further with digital zoom (I had this setting turned off, and the video was still horribly soft). The worst part of this lens is the coating, there just doesn't appear to be any multilayer anti-reflection coating on the lens. I have never seen so much front element flare in my life. I was shooting in a room with fairly bright lights overhead; depending on where I stood the image was completely washed out with flare. From the exact same spot, my iPhone didn't have that problem.<br /><br />The only good thing about this lens is the wide angle. It is one of the widest lenses I have ever seen. I shoot volleyball matches and this is perfect to get the full court into the shot.<br /><br />Still images are just fine outside. Indoors in low light, image noise is a huge problem - the pictures are extremely grainy. I would say they are just slightly worse than an iPhone in the same situation.<br /><br />The video quality is good. I have a Canon HD video camera (Vixia HFM400) and the video looks pretty similar between these two. Image stabilization is surprisingly good on this camera. It does filter out hand shakiness surprisingly well.<br /><br />The recorded audio is absolutely outstanding. This blew me away, with all the other problems with this camera; I didn't expect the sound to be that good. I recorded a friend's rock concert - I'm pretty certain the audio was up in the 100db range, it was loud. The camera managed to attenuate that sound and record it perfectly. That's a feat not many cameras can accomplish. As usual, the microphone picks up sound all around, so noise will be picked up from everywhere.<br /><br />There are some decent features that took me a while to figure out and find. I do like the focus follow feature; touching the screen on the thing you want to maintain in focus will then follow that thing around the screen keeping it in nearly perfect focus. The battery seems to have a fairly long life. The camera does weigh nothing at all - it is teeny tiny (shoot the AC adapter is almost bigger and heavier than the camera).<br /><br />The camera is very particular about SD cards. I tried an ez Share 16GB class 10 card, the camera got all finicky about recording to it. The first three minute clip recorded fine, but then the camera went into an impossible to leave circle of trying to recover images and files from the card. I eventually went back to the internal memory. The first clip was recorded correctly.<br /><br />Transferring movies to a computer is a living nightmare. For some unknown reason the computer can only see thememory that was selected for recording. So if I need to transfer movies from both the internal memory and an SD card, I have to connect the camera twice messing with that stupid setup menu to select recording media. It is a stupid waste of time. The video and still images are included in a single folder. This connects at USB 2 speeds - meaning it takes forever to transfer HD movies.<br /><br />I didn't mess with any Sony software for this camera. There was no disc included in the box, only a website to go download software. In fact there was no description of what software I could get there or why I might need it.<br /><br />There is a lot that I dislike about this camera. For the price, there are much better cameras with better ergonomics, better lenses, and easier to use. On the other hand, I haven't seen a camera with as wide a lens, and none of the others have a projector. If for some reason you absolutely have to have a projector on your camera, well this is the camera for you. When it comes down to it, this is more like a $250 camcorder that had a projector bolted on for an additional $150.
10700	__label2__	5	N	Tools	B008NM6VSC	Crescent DB18X 18-Inch Indexing Flat Pry bar, Red/Black	A perfect demo tool	I confess...if I had to pick a favorite part of a home project, it would have to be demo.  There's just something...satisfying about knocking down something that's bugged you enough to want to renovate it.  It speaks to that prehistoric reptilian portion of our brains.<br /><br />This is a very good tool, not just for general demo but for uses where a crowbar would be too big.  First check:  it's heavy and sturdy, which is something that a good breaker bar/demo tool should be.  It's solid and substantial.<br /><br />Second check: it has a good handle.  The handle is important, not just for giving you a good grip, but for absorbing vibrations when you go to town on something.  Indeed, the head has a nice flat spot that doubles as a, ahem, &#34;percussive tool&#34; to slam the heck out of things.  And it works.<br /><br />Third check: it's versatile.  By that I mean it has an adjustable head.  This means if you need to pry something at an odd angle, you can adjust the head and get a 90 degree angle from the handle and whatever you're prying.  This makes life a LOT easier.<br /><br />In sum, this is the archetypal demo tool, easy to use and built to last.  I love it.
